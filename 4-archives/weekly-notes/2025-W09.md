# Reflections
## Wins - what Gave Me Energy?
- the new fvp productivity system works pretty well and is motivating me to do hard things that I am resisting
- The climbing app is also motivating me to go climbing more and get better
- some good night sleeps
- reading mark forster productivity book
## Losses - what Drained Energy?
- doom scrolling ig reels until very late
- binge eating pizza greasy food
- spending hours on youtube for no reasons
- drinking 3 pints and feeling hangover the next day and unable to code
- netflix binge sessions
## What Should I Say no To?
- the third pint of beer
- gorging on fast food (i can do a reasonably sized pizza if I want to, don't need to get in pain)
## What Will I Do that Allow Me to Say Yes To?
- continue tracking my time for youtube / netflix
## Gratitude:
- Zishu being so nice with me
- living in a great flat
- being able to take a long break from work thanks to the redundancy
## Goals for the Week Ahead:
- refactor climbing app
- start backend with the sync db functionality
- adding spider chart for climbing sessions
- make music (producing) in the morning
- get a client for mastering
