I went to bed really late the day before and that ruined my whole energy for the day. I shall try not to do that again.
Went climbing despite the low energy to do a little bit of kilter board and that went actually pretty well. Flashed a V3 and should be able to do a bit more than that even which is nice.

Manage to do the whole Firebase Auth flow with storage of the token to async storage. Need to put that in a note in Obsidian so that I don't have to go through the whole video again.
