# News from The Time Freedom Coach
In this example for ease of understanding no new tasks are added while working on the list. This of course is unlikely in real life.

Your initial list of tasks:

Email 

In-Tray

Voicemail

Project X Report

Tidy Desk

Call Dissatisfied Customer

Make Dental Appointment

File Invoices

Discuss Project Y with Bob

Back Up  

Put a dot in front of the first task:  

� Email 

  In-Tray

  Voicemail

  Project X Report

  Tidy Desk

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

  Back Up

Now ask yourself " What do I want to do before I do Email?"

You work down the list and come to Voicemail. You decide you want to do Voicemail before doing Email. Put a dot in front of it.  

� Email 

  In-Tray

� Voicemail

  Project X Report

  Tidy Desk

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

  Back Up  

Now ask yourself " What do I want to do before I do Voicemail?" You decide you want to tidy your desk.  

� Email 

  In-Tray

� Voicemail

  Project X Report

� Tidy Desk

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

  Back Up  

There are no tasks you want to do before tidying your desk, so now take action on the dotted tasks in reverse order:  

Tidy Desk

Voicemail

Email  

Your list will now look like this (I've removed the tasks that have been actioned but if you are using paper they will still be on the page but crossed out):  

  In-Tray

  Project X Report

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

  Back Up  

Now start again with the first unactioned task on the list, In-Tray, and repeat the same procedure. The only task you want to do before In-Tray is Back Up. As this is the last task on the list there are only two dotted tasks: 

� In-Tray

  Project X Report

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

� Back Up

Do the two dotted tasks in reverse order:

Back Up

In-Tray

So the list now looks like this:

  Project X Report

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

  Make Dental Appointment

  File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

So far the tasks have been relatively trivial, but the Project X Report is something that you have been putting off doing for a long time. So repeat the procedure:

� Project X Report

  Call Dissatisfied Customer

� Make Dental Appointment

� File Invoices

  Discuss Project Y with Bob

You now file your invoices, make a dental appointment and make a start on the Project X Report.

In your final pass through the list you Discuss Project Y with Bob and Call Dissatisfied Customer.

So the tasks on the original list have been done in the following order. The tasks in italics are the ones at the beginning of each scanning process.

Tidy Desk

Voicemail

*Email*

Back Up

*In-Tray*

File Invoices,

Make Dental Appointment

*Project X Report*

Discuss Project Y with Bob

*Call Dissatisfied Customer*

Notice what has happened here. The root tasks (the ones in italics) have been done in strict list order, regardless of importance, urgency or any other factor. Some of them are relatively easy (e.g. Email) and some are relatively difficult (e.g. Project X Report) or you are reluctant to do them (e.g. Call Dissatisfied Customer).

Each of the root tasks is preceded by a short ladder of tasks which are in the order in which you want to do them. The number and difficulty of the tasks in the ladder tend to reflect the difficulty of the root tasks.
