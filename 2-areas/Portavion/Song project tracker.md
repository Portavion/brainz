# Song Project Tracker
**Goal:** To take a song idea through detailed arrangement, high-quality recording, editing, mixing, and mastering for a polished, release-ready track.
### **Phase 1: Songwriting & Pre-Production**
- [ ] **Finalise Lyrics:** Complete and refine all lyrics for all sections. Ensure they flow and convey the intended meaning.
- [ ] **Finalise Melody & Harmonies:** Lock in the lead vocal melody. Write and confirm any backing vocal harmonies or instrumental counter-melodies.
- [ ] **Finalise Chord Progression:** Confirm all chords and voicings.
- [ ] **Finalise Song Structure:** Confirm the exact arrangement of sections, number of bars per section, transitions.
- [ ] **Determine Final Tempo & Key:** Lock these in. Create a tempo map in your DAW if there are tempo changes.
- [ ] **Create Detailed Arrangement Plan:** Decide on specific instrumentation for each section. Plan layers, textures, dynamics, and how instruments interact.
- [ ] **Create Scratch Track/Guide Tracks:** Record solid guide versions of key elements (e.g., guide vocal, rhythm instrument) to the final tempo and structure.
- [ ] **Prepare DAW Session:** Set up the project file with the correct tempo, markers for sections, name and colour-code tracks logically.
- [ ] **Plan Recording Logistics:** Choose microphones, plan input lists, check gear, schedule session time (if collaborating or using external studios).
### **Phase 2: Tracking/Recording**
- [ ] **Record Rhythm Section Foundation (Drums/Percussion):** Focus on tight, high-quality recordings.
- [ ] **Record Bass Guitar/Synth Bass:** Ensure it locks in tightly with the rhythm foundation.
- [ ] **Record Harmony Instruments (Guitars, Keyboards, Synths):** Layer parts according to the arrangement plan. Pay attention to tone and performance.
- [ ] **Record Lead Instruments/Solos:** Capture compelling performances for any instrumental leads or solos.
- [ ] **Record Lead Vocals:** Focus on delivering the best possible emotional and technical performance. Record multiple takes.
- [ ] **Record Backing Vocals & Harmonies:** Ensure tight timing and tuning with the lead vocal and each other.
- [ ] **Record Additional Layers/Ear Candy:** Add any planned textures, sound effects, pads, or extra percussive elements.
- [ ] **Review Takes & Select Best Performances (Comping):** Listen through takes and compile the best phrases/sections for each part (especially vocals).
### **Phase 3: Editing**
- [ ] **Edit Drums/Percussion:** Correct timing issues (quantise if appropriate), align phase between microphones (e.g., kick & snare), edit fills.
- [ ] **Edit Bass:** Tighten timing against the drums.
- [ ] **Edit Harmony Instruments:** Correct timing, clean up any noise or mistakes between phrases.
- [ ] **Edit Lead Instruments:** Ensure timing is solid, clean up noise.
- [ ] **Edit Lead Vocals:** Fine-tune the comped vocal take. Apply pitch correction (if desired/needed). Correct timing.
- [ ] **Edit Backing Vocals:** Align timing and pitch precisely with the lead vocal and each other.
- [ ] **Clean Up Tracks:** Remove silence, breaths (if desired), clicks, pops, hum, or other extraneous noises from all tracks. Apply fades/crossfades.
- [ ] **Consolidate Regions/Clips:** Create continuous audio files for edited tracks where appropriate (makes mixing easier).
- [ ] **Organize Session for Mixing:** Ensure tracks are clearly labelled, colour-coded, grouped logically (e.g., all drums together, all vocals together). Remove unused tracks.
### **Phase 4: Mixing**
- [ ] **Set Initial Static Balance:** Adjust volume faders and pan positions for a basic, clear balance with no processing yet. Check headroom.
- [ ] **Apply Corrective EQ:** Use EQ to remove problematic frequencies (mud, harshness) on individual tracks. High-pass filter where appropriate.
- [ ] **Apply Compression:** Use compression to control dynamics, add punch, glue elements together (e.g., drum bus, vocal).
- [ ] **Apply Creative EQ:** Use EQ to shape the tone of instruments and vocals, helping them fit together in the mix.
- [ ] **Add Effects (Reverb, Delay, Modulation, etc.):** Use sends/returns or inserts to add spatial effects and character.
- [ ] **Process Vocals:** Apply specific vocal chain (e.g., EQ, compression, de-essing, saturation, delay, reverb). Ensure intelligibility and appropriate presence.
- [ ] **Implement Automation:** Automate volume, panning, effects sends, plug-in parameters to create movement, dynamics, and interest throughout the song.
- [ ] **Check Mix in Mono:** Ensure the mix translates well and doesn't suffer from major phase issues.
- [ ] **Reference Against Professional Tracks:** Compare your mix to commercially released songs in a similar genre. Check levels, balance, and overall tonality.
- [ ] **Perform Mix Revisions:** Take breaks, listen on different sound systems (headphones, monitors, car, phone), get feedback if possible, and make adjustments.
- [ ] **Export Final Mix (Pre-Master):** Bounce the final mix, leaving sufficient headroom (-3dBFS to -6dBFS peak is common) for mastering. Use the project's sample rate and bit depth.
### **Phase 5: Mastering**
- [ ] **Prepare Session for Mastering (If self-mastering):** Import the final mix into a new session or use mastering plugins on the master bus.
- [ ] **Apply Final EQ:** Make broad tonal adjustments to balance the overall frequency spectrum.
- [ ] **Apply Final Compression/Multi-band Compression:** Glue the mix together, control overall dynamics, add density if needed.
- [ ] **Use Stereo Widening (Optional & Subtle):** Enhance stereo width if desired, checking for mono compatibility.
- [ ] **Apply Limiting:** Increase the overall loudness to competitive levels while preventing clipping. Set the output ceiling (e.g., -0.1dBFS to -1.0dBFS).
- [ ] **Check Against References:** Compare loudness and tonality to reference tracks.
- [ ] **Dithering (If changing bit depth):** Apply dither if reducing bit depth for the final export (e.g., from 24-bit to 16-bit for CD).
- [ ] **Export Master Files:** Create final master files in required formats (e.g., 16-bit/44.1kHz WAV for CD, high-resolution WAV for digital distribution, MP3 for sharing).
- [ ] **Add Metadata (Optional but Recommended):** Embed ISRC codes, artist/track information into the files if possible/needed.
### **Phase 6: Final Review & Release Prep**
- [ ] **Final Listening Tests:** Listen to the mastered track(s) on multiple systems and in different environments one last time.
- [ ] **Approve Master(s):** Confirm you are happy with the final sound.
- [ ] **Prepare Artwork:** Finalize cover art according to specifications for distribution.
- [ ] **Prepare Release Information:** Gather all necessary credits, lyrics (for distribution platforms), and any liner notes.
- [ ] **Choose Distribution Method/Aggregator:** Select how you will release the song (e.g., DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby, Bandcamp).
- [ ] **Upload Assets & Schedule Release:** Upload master audio, artwork, and metadata to your chosen distributor. Set the release date.
- [ ] **Archive Project Files:** Back up everything! Raw audio tracks, session files (clearly labelled versions for writing, tracking, mixing, mastering), mix stems (optional), final mixes, and masters.
