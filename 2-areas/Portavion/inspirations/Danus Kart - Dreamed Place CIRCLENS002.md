Following a first strong release, Circlens now announces his second one,featuring Danus Kart. His debut EP "Dreamed Place" comes with three original tracks and a remix by Møhr, who had already made his appearance on the label collaborating with My Flower. The first track, "Dreamed Place" sounds either soft and aggressive at the same time, with his ethereal synths joining the techno drums during the whole duration of it. "Il demonio" puts on the table a serious groove, notes flows between pauses and surprises. "Foliage" is emotion at first listening. Sounds like a dry leaves carpet fallen off. The strongest part is the breakdown, a very high energy moment. Finally, Møhr's remix, a very techno interpretation of the original track, closes the EP, making it playable at any time of the set.
