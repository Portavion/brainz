## Workflow 1: Creating a Song Demo

**Goal:** To capture the core idea of the song (melody, harmony, structure, key lyrics) quickly and effectively. Quality is secondary to conveying the concept. Useful for sharing with bandmates, collaborators, producers, or just for documenting an idea before you forget it.

**Phase 1: Idea & Foundation**

- `[ ]` **Capture Initial Spark:** Record voice memo, jot down lyric ideas, record riff on phone/DAW.
- `[ ]` **Define Core Concept/Mood:** What's the song _about_? What feeling are you aiming for?
- `[ ]` **Establish Tempo (BPM):** Use a metronome or tap tempo to find a comfortable speed. Record it.
- `[ ]` **Establish Key Signature:** Identify the key the main ideas are in.
- `[ ]` **Develop Main Chord Progression(s):** Work out the chords for the main sections (verse, chorus).
- `[ ]` **Develop Main Melody:** Hum, sing, or play the primary tune (usually vocal melody).
- `[ ]` **Draft Core Lyrics:** Focus on getting the main message across, especially for the chorus and maybe the first verse. Don't worry about perfection yet.
- `[ ]` **Outline Basic Song Structure:** Map out the sections (e.g., Intro - Verse 1 - Chorus - Verse 2 - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus - Outro).

**Phase 2: Basic Arrangement & Recording**

- `[ ]` **Choose Essential Instruments:** What's the minimum needed to convey the idea? (e.g., Acoustic Guitar + Vocal, Piano + Vocal, Basic Beat + Bass + Vocal).
- `[ ]` **Set Up Simple Recording Session:** Create a new project in your DAW or set up basic recording gear. Use the established tempo.
- `[ ]` **Record Rhythm Foundation:** Lay down the main chord instrument (e.g., guitar strumming, piano chords) to a click track.
- `[ ]` **Record Basic Beat/Percussion (Optional):** Add a simple drum loop or basic programmed beat if rhythm is key to the idea.
- `[ ]` **Record Bass Line Idea (Optional):** Sketch a simple bass line that supports the chords.
- `[ ]` **Record Guide Vocal:** Sing the main melody and drafted lyrics. Focus on getting the tune and timing right, not a perfect performance.
- `[ ]` **Record Main Instrumental Hooks/Melodies (Optional):** If there's a key riff or instrumental melody, record a basic version.

**Phase 3: Refinement & Demo Mix**

- `[ ]` **Review Structure & Flow:** Listen back. Does the arrangement make sense? Does it capture the intended energy? Make quick adjustments if needed.
- `[ ]` **Perform Basic Edits:** Remove any major mistakes, obvious glitches, or long silences. Maybe slightly nudge timing if something is way off.
- `[ ]` **Set Basic Volume Levels (Rough Mix):** Adjust track faders so all essential elements are audible and balanced relative to each other. Ensure the vocal is clear.
- `[ ]` **Add Minimal Effects (Optional):** Maybe a touch of reverb on the vocal to give it space, but avoid heavy processing.
- `[ ]` **Listen Back Critically:** Does the demo successfully communicate the song's core idea, melody, and structure?
- `[ ]` **Bounce/Export Demo Mix:** Export the track as an MP3 or WAV file.

**Phase 4: Final Check & Documentation**

- `[ ]` **Listen on Different Systems (Optional):** Briefly check how it sounds on phone speakers or headphones.
- `[ ]` **Label & Archive File:** Name the file clearly (e.g., "SONGTITLE_Demo_V1_Date.mp3"). Save your project file.
- `[ ]` **Add Notes:** Jot down any immediate thoughts for future development (e.g., "Needs better bridge," "Try different chords in verse 2," "Tempo feels a bit slow").

## Workflow 2: Finishing a Song (Full Production)

**Goal:** To take a song idea (often starting from a demo) through detailed arrangement, high-quality recording, editing, mixing, and mastering for a polished, release-ready track.

**Phase 1: Songwriting & Pre-Production**

- `[ ]` **Finalize Lyrics:** Complete and refine all lyrics for all sections. Ensure they flow and convey the intended meaning.
- `[ ]` **Finalize Melody & Harmonies:** Lock in the lead vocal melody. Write and confirm any backing vocal harmonies or instrumental counter-melodies.
- `[ ]` **Finalize Chord Progression:** Confirm all chords and voicings.
- `[ ]` **Finalize Song Structure:** Confirm the exact arrangement of sections, number of bars per section, transitions.
- `[ ]` **Determine Final Tempo & Key:** Lock these in. Create a tempo map in your DAW if there are tempo changes.
- `[ ]` **Create Detailed Arrangement Plan:** Decide on specific instrumentation for each section. Plan layers, textures, dynamics, and how instruments interact.
- `[ ]` **Create Scratch Track/Guide Tracks:** Record solid guide versions of key elements (e.g., guide vocal, rhythm instrument) to the final tempo and structure.
- `[ ]` **Prepare DAW Session:** Set up the project file with the correct tempo, markers for sections, name and colour-code tracks logically.
- `[ ]` **Plan Recording Logistics:** Choose microphones, plan input lists, check gear, schedule session time (if collaborating or using external studios).

**Phase 2: Tracking/Recording**

- `[ ]` **Record Rhythm Section Foundation (Drums/Percussion):** Focus on tight, high-quality recordings. Use appropriate mics and techniques.
- `[ ]` **Record Bass Guitar/Synth Bass:** Ensure it locks in tightly with the rhythm foundation.
- `[ ]` **Record Harmony Instruments (Guitars, Keyboards, Synths):** Layer parts according to the arrangement plan. Pay attention to tone and performance.
- `[ ]` **Record Lead Instruments/Solos:** Capture compelling performances for any instrumental leads or solos.
- `[ ]` **Record Lead Vocals:** Focus on delivering the best possible emotional and technical performance. Record multiple takes.
- `[ ]` **Record Backing Vocals & Harmonies:** Ensure tight timing and tuning with the lead vocal and each other.
- `[ ]` **Record Additional Layers/Ear Candy:** Add any planned textures, sound effects, pads, or extra percussive elements.
- `[ ]` **Review Takes & Select Best Performances (Comping):** Listen through takes and compile the best phrases/sections for each part (especially vocals).

**Phase 3: Editing**

- `[ ]` **Edit Drums/Percussion:** Correct timing issues (quantize if appropriate), align phase between microphones (e.g., kick & snare), edit fills.
- `[ ]` **Edit Bass:** Tighten timing against the drums.
- `[ ]` **Edit Harmony Instruments:** Correct timing, clean up any noise or mistakes between phrases.
- `[ ]` **Edit Lead Instruments:** Ensure timing is solid, clean up noise.
- `[ ]` **Edit Lead Vocals:** Fine-tune the comped vocal take. Apply pitch correction (if desired/needed). Correct timing.
- `[ ]` **Edit Backing Vocals:** Align timing and pitch precisely with the lead vocal and each other.
- `[ ]` **Clean Up Tracks:** Remove silence, breaths (if desired), clicks, pops, hum, or other extraneous noises from all tracks. Apply fades/crossfades.
- `[ ]` **Consolidate Regions/Clips:** Create continuous audio files for edited tracks where appropriate (makes mixing easier).
- `[ ]` **Organize Session for Mixing:** Ensure tracks are clearly labelled, colour-coded, grouped logically (e.g., all drums together, all vocals together). Remove unused tracks.

**Phase 4: Mixing**

- `[ ]` **Set Initial Static Balance:** Adjust volume faders and pan positions for a basic, clear balance with no processing yet. Check headroom.
- `[ ]` **Apply Corrective EQ:** Use EQ to remove problematic frequencies (mud, harshness) on individual tracks. High-pass filter where appropriate.
- `[ ]` **Apply Compression:** Use compression to control dynamics, add punch, glue elements together (e.g., drum bus, vocal).
- `[ ]` **Apply Creative EQ:** Use EQ to shape the tone of instruments and vocals, helping them fit together in the mix.
- `[ ]` **Add Effects (Reverb, Delay, Modulation, etc.):** Use sends/returns or inserts to add spatial effects and character.
- `[ ]` **Process Vocals:** Apply specific vocal chain (e.g., EQ, compression, de-essing, saturation, delay, reverb). Ensure intelligibility and appropriate presence.
- `[ ]` **Implement Automation:** Automate volume, panning, effects sends, plug-in parameters to create movement, dynamics, and interest throughout the song.
- `[ ]` **Check Mix in Mono:** Ensure the mix translates well and doesn't suffer from major phase issues.
- `[ ]` **Reference Against Professional Tracks:** Compare your mix to commercially released songs in a similar genre. Check levels, balance, and overall tonality.
- `[ ]` **Perform Mix Revisions:** Take breaks, listen on different sound systems (headphones, monitors, car, phone), get feedback if possible, and make adjustments.
- `[ ]` **Export Final Mix (Pre-Master):** Bounce the final mix, leaving sufficient headroom (-3dBFS to -6dBFS peak is common) for mastering. Use the project's sample rate and bit depth.

**Phase 5: Mastering**

- _Note: This can be done yourself or by sending the mix to a dedicated mastering engineer._
- `[ ]` **Prepare Session for Mastering (If self-mastering):** Import the final mix into a new session or use mastering plugins on the master bus.
- `[ ]` **Apply Final EQ:** Make broad tonal adjustments to balance the overall frequency spectrum.
- `[ ]` **Apply Final Compression/Multi-band Compression:** Glue the mix together, control overall dynamics, add density if needed.
- `[ ]` **Use Stereo Widening (Optional & Subtle):** Enhance stereo width if desired, checking for mono compatibility.
- `[ ]` **Apply Limiting:** Increase the overall loudness to competitive levels while preventing clipping. Set the output ceiling (e.g., -0.1dBFS to -1.0dBFS).
- `[ ]` **Check Against References:** Compare loudness and tonality to reference tracks.
- `[ ]` **Dithering (If changing bit depth):** Apply dither if reducing bit depth for the final export (e.g., from 24-bit to 16-bit for CD).
- `[ ]` **Export Master Files:** Create final master files in required formats (e.g., 16-bit/44.1kHz WAV for CD, high-resolution WAV for digital distribution, MP3 for sharing).
- `[ ]` **Add Metadata (Optional but Recommended):** Embed ISRC codes, artist/track information into the files if possible/needed.
