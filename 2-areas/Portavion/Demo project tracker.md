# Demo Project Tracker
**Goal:** To capture the core idea of the song (melody, harmony, structure, key lyrics) quickly and effectively. Quality is secondary to conveying the concept. Useful for sharing with bandmates, collaborators, producers, or just for documenting an idea before you forget it.
### **Phase 1: Idea & Foundation**
- **Capture Initial Idea:** Record voice memo, jot down lyric ideas, record riff on phone/DAW.
- **Define Core Concept/Mood:** What's the song _about_? What feeling are you aiming for?
- **Establish Tempo (BPM):** Use a metronome or tap tempo to find a comfortable speed. Record it.
- **Develop Main Chord Progression(s):** Work out the chords for the main sections (verse, chorus).
- **Establish Key Signature:** Identify the key the main ideas are in.
- **Develop Main Melody:** Hum, sing, or play the primary tune (usually vocal melody).
- **Draft Core Lyrics:** Focus on getting the main message across, especially for the chorus and maybe the first verse. Don't worry about perfection yet.
- **Outline Basic Song Structure:** Map out the sections (e.g., Intro - Verse 1 - Chorus - Verse 2 - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus - Outro).
### **Phase 2: Basic Arrangement & Recording**
- **Choose Essential Instruments:** What's the minimum needed to convey the idea? (e.g., Acoustic Guitar + Vocal, Piano + Vocal, Basic Beat + Bass + Vocal).
- **Set Up Simple Recording Session:** Create a new project in your DAW or set up basic recording gear. Use the established tempo.
- **Record Rhythm Foundation:** Lay down the main chord instrument (e.g., guitar strumming, piano chords) to a click track.
- **Record Basic Beat/Percussion (Optional):** Add a simple drum loop or basic programmed beat if rhythm is key to the idea.
- **Record Bass Line Idea (Optional):** Sketch a simple bass line that supports the chords.
- **Record Guide Vocal:** Sing the main melody and drafted lyrics. Focus on getting the tune and timing right, not a perfect performance.
- **Record Main Instrumental Hooks/Melodies (Optional):** If there's a key riff or instrumental melody, record a basic version.
### **Phase 3: Refinement & Demo Mix**
- **Review Structure & Flow:** Listen back. Does the arrangement make sense? Does it capture the intended energy? Make quick adjustments if needed.
- **Perform Basic Edits:** Remove any major mistakes, obvious glitches, or long silences. Maybe slightly nudge timing if something is way off.
- **Set Basic Volume Levels (Rough Mix):** Adjust track faders so all essential elements are audible and balanced relative to each other. Ensure the vocal is clear.
- **Add Minimal Effects (Optional):** Maybe a touch of reverb on the vocal to give it space, but avoid heavy processing.
- **Listen Back Critically:** Does the demo successfully communicate the song's core idea, melody, and structure?
- **Bounce/Export Demo Mix:** Export the track as an MP3 or WAV file.
### **Phase 4: Final Check & Documentation**
- **Label & Archive File:** Name the file clearly (e.g., "SONGTITLE_Demo_V1_Date.mp3"). Save your project file.
- **Add Notes:** Jot down any immediate thoughts for future development (e.g., "Needs better bridge," "Try different chords in verse 2," "Tempo feels a bit slow").
