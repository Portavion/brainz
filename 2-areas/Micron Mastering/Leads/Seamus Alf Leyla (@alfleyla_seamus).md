### You

Hey mate, cheers for the follow! Just checked out some of your tune. Love the end is near. Nice full bassline and emotional lead. Are you working on any cool tunes at the moment?

### You

Snow Day v4FINAL

### You

Hey thanks for sending those through. Snow Day is really dope, some proper goosebump inducing moments in there. Very catchy lead. Digging the more laidback vibes of Calmer too, just feel like the drums are slightly overpowering the rest of the mix, very beefy against the melodies / pace. But maybe that was the goal! (hope the unsolicited feedback is ok)

Are you planning on self-releasing those?
