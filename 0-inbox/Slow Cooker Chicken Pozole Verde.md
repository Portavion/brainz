- **2** **tsp.**

ground cumin
- Kosher salt and pepper
- **1** **1/2** **lb.**

boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
- **12** **oz.**

tomatillos, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- **4**

cloves garlic, finely chopped
- **1**

onion, finely chopped
- **1**

poblano, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- **1/2**

small bunch cilantro, plus leaves for serving
- **1**

28-oz. can hominy, rinsed
- **1/4** **cup**

fresh lime juice
- Diced avocado and sliced radishes, for serving

## Directions

- 1. Step 1In 5- to 6-quart slow cooker, combine beer, bouillon base, cumin, 2 cups water, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.
2. Step 2Add chicken, tomatillos, garlic, onion, poblano, and cilantro and mix to combine. Cook, covered, until chicken is easily pulled apart, 4 to 5 hours on High or 6 to 7 hours on Low.
3. Step 3Remove and discard cilantro from slow cooker; then, using 2 forks, break chicken into smaller pieces. Add hominy and cook, covered, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in lime juice and serve with cilantro, avocado, and radishes if desired.

GH Test Kitchen Tip: For extra leftovers, cook up a double batch. Before adding the lime juice, freeze half in an airtight container for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then warm and top as desired.
