## Rower Exercise
### Question i
For this question, we will assume that our rowing speed is constant and we ignore factors like fatigue and wind. As the river Thames is flowing to the sea, this induces a current, we will assume that the speed of the current is constant and not null. We also assume that our rowing speed is greater than the current speed, otherwise we would not be able to row against the current and that agitation of the water on the river is not affecting our performance.

Given all these assumptions, rowing on the river Thames will be slower than rowing on the lake.

### Question 2
Rowing on the lake is a constant effort and will take the same amount of time in both directions.

When rowing downstream, with the current, we get a speed increase for the current and save time on the first leg. When rowing upstream, against the current, we get a speed decrease from the current and take more time to complete the return journey. 

However, the time saved downstream in lower than the extra time spent going upstream. This is because we spent less time under the benefit of downstream current and more time fighting against the current. The speed decrease has a proportionally bigger impact than the speed increase giving an overall slower speed on the river Thames than on the lake.

### Question 3
Based on the drawing we might be trying to figure out the distance z to take the shortest path around the river bend.

### Question 4 

This approach doesn't take dynamic into account, the optimal path inside a turn also depends of the speed we are travelling at. 

 iv) **What are the limitations of this approach?**

This approach has several limitations for accurately determining the best racing line:

1. **Oversimplification of Current:** The diagram and a simple float like a paper boat cannot capture the complex three-dimensional nature of river currents. Current speed varies not just across the width but also with depth, and bends create complex flow patterns (like helical flow) and eddies that aren't represented.
2. **Paper Boat vs. Racing Shell:** A paper boat is light, affected significantly by wind and surface tension, and has negligible momentum or draft (depth in the water). Its path doesn't accurately reflect how a larger, heavier, and faster racing boat interacts with the current, especially deeper currents, or how the boat's own momentum influences its path through the turn.
3. **Ignoring Boat Dynamics:** The optimal path also depends on the handling characteristics of your specific boat (e.g., its turning radius) and the speed you are travelling.
4. **Ignoring External Factors:** This doesn't account for wind conditions, water depth variations, potential obstacles (submerged or otherwise), or the strategic movements of competitors during the actual race.
5. **Static Representation:** The diagram is a snapshot. River flow rates and patterns can change depending on recent rainfall, tides (if applicable), or upstream conditions.


iii) **What might you be trying to figure out?**

Based on the diagram showing a bend in the river with different potential paths (`b`, `z`, `w`) indicated, you are likely trying to figure out the **fastest or most optimal path (racing line) to navigate the river bend**. This involves understanding the trade-off between: * The **distance** travelled (the inside path `b` is shorter than the outside path `w`). * The **speed of the river current**, which often varies across the width of a river, typically being faster on the outside of a bend. The paper boat might be a rudimentary way to visualize or estimate the path the surface current takes at a certain distance from the bank.
