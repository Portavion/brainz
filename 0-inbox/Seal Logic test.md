## Rower Exercise
### Question i
For this question, we will assume that our rowing speed is constant and we ignore factors like fatigue and wind. As the river Thames is flowing to the sea, this induces a current, we will assume that the speed of the 




**Assumptions:**

1. Your rowing speed relative to the water (the speed you'd achieve on the still lake through your own effort) is constant. Let's call this speed `v_r`.
2. The speed of the river current is constant and non-zero. Let's call this speed `v_c`.
3. Your rowing speed `v_r` is greater than the river current speed `v_c` (otherwise, you couldn't row back upstream).
4. The distance for each leg (out/downstream and back/upstream) is exactly 1km.
5. We ignore factors like turning time, fatigue, wind, etc.

**Solution:**

i) It takes **longer** to row on the Thames.
