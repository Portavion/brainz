## Rower Exercise
### Question i
For this question, we will assume that our rowing speed is constant and we ignore factors like fatigue and wind. As the river Thames is flowing to the sea, this induces a current, we will assume that the speed of the current is constant and not null. We also assume that our rowing speed is greater than the current speed, otherwise we would not be able to row against the current and that agitation of the water on the river is not affecting our performance.

Given all these assumptions, rowing on the river Thames will be slower than rowing on the lake.

### Question 2
Rowing on the lake is a constant effort and will take the same amount of time in both directions.

When rowing downstream, with the current, we get a speed increase for the current and save time on the first leg. When rowing upstream, against the current, we get a speed decrease from the current and take more time to complete the return journey. 

However, the time saved downstream in lower than the extra time spent going upstream. This is because we spent less time under the benefit of downstream current and more time fighting against the current. The speed decrease has a proportionally bigger impact than the speed increase giving an overall slower speed on the river Thames than on the lake.

### Question 3
Based on the drawing we might be trying to figure out the distance z to take the shortest path around the river bend.

### Question 4 

This approach doesn't take speed into account, the optimal path inside a turn also depends of the speed we are travelling at. It also doesn't take into account that current speed varies across the width and is generally slower the closer you get to the bank.
## Breakfast
### Question 1
The range of people ordering a full english breakfast is 21 to 70.

You need to order all items to get a full english breakfast, therefore the maximum of order cannot be higher than the least ordered item, which here is bean (70)

To get the minimum amount of full english order, we need to find the maximum amount of people that would have missed at least one of the option. If 91 people ordered eggs, than only 9 can have missed at least that item. Similarly, 14 could have missed bacon, 20 toast and 30 beans. In the worst case, that amounts to 73 people that could have missed at least one item, meaning that the remaining 27 people must have ordered a full english breakfast.
### Question 2
We are at the back of the wagon so will be served last. All items are very popular relative to the assumed 100 passengers with almost every passenger ordering egg and / or bacon (91% and 86%) It is very likely that at least one item will run out before our turn.
