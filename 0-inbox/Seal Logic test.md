## Rower Exercise
### Question i
For this question, we will assume that our rowing speed is constant and we ignore factors like fatigue and wind. As the river Thames is flowing to the sea, this induces a current, we will assume that the speed of the current is constant and not null. We also assume that our rowing speed is greater than the current speed, otherwise we would not be able to row against the current and that agitation of the water on the river is not affecting our performance.

Given all these assumptions, rowing on the river Thames will be slower than rowing on the lake.

### Question 2
Rowing on the lake is a constant effort and will take the same amount of time in both directions.

When rowing downstream, with the current, we get a speed increase for the current and save time on the first leg. When rowing upstream, against the current, we get a speed decrease from the current and take more time to complete the return journey. 

However, the time saved downstream in lower than the extra time spent going upstream. This is because we spent less time under the benefit of downstream current and more time fighting against the current. The speed decrease has a proportionally bigger impact than the speed increase giving an overall slower speed on the river Thames than on the lake.

### Question 3
Based on the drawing we might be trying to figure out the distance z to take the shortest path around the river bend.

### Question 4 

This approach doesn't take speed into account, the optimal path inside a turn also depends of the speed we are travelling at. It also doesn't take into account that current speed varies across the width and is generally slower the closer you get to the bank.
