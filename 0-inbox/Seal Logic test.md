## Rower Exercise
### Question i
For this question, we will assume that our rowing speed is constant and we ignore factors like fatigue and wind. As the river Thames is flowing to the sea, this induces a current, we will assume that the speed of the current is constant and not null. We also assume that our rowing speed is greater than the current speed, otherwise we would not be able to row against the current and that agitation of the water on the river is not affecting our performance.

Given all these assumptions, rowing on the river Thames will be slower than rowing on the lake.

### Question 2
Rowing on the lake is a constant effort and will take the same amount of time in both directions.

When rowing with the current on the river Thames, we get a speed increase for the current and save time on the first leg. When rowing against the current, we get a speed decrease from the current and take more time to complete the return journey. 

However, 



**Assumptions:**

1. Your rowing speed relative to the water (the speed you'd achieve on the still lake through your own effort) is constant. Let's call this speed `v_r`.
2. The speed of the river current is constant and non-zero. Let's call this speed `v_c`.
3. Your rowing speed `v_r` is greater than the river current speed `v_c` (otherwise, you couldn't row back upstream).
4. The distance for each leg (out/downstream and back/upstream) is exactly 1km.
5. We ignore factors like turning time, fatigue, wind, etc.

**Solution:**

i) It takes **longer** to row on the Thames.
