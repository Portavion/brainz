Get ready friends, because Dijon is having a moment! This Creamy Dijon Chicken starts with quick [pan-seared chicken breasts](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-cook-chicken-breast-in-a-pan/) that get covered with a creamy, luscious, Dijon mustard sauce. It’s one of those recipes that feels luxurious and expensive, but is really made with simple inexpensive ingredients. And my secret ingredient to making it extra special…just a hint of Worcestershire sauce. This Dijon chicken recipe is so delicious and guaranteed to be one the whole family enjoys!

This recipe uses one of my favorite ingredient combinations: Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. And when they’re combined with a little bit of heavy cream and parmesan cheese, it creates the most delicious sauce! So here’s everything that you’ll need:

- **Chicken Breasts:** Chicken breasts are my usual go-to for recipes like these, but you can certainly use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead.
- **Garlic:** Just a couple of garlic cloves infuses the sauce with lots of flavor.
- **Olive Oil and Butter:** Olive oil is used to cook the chicken breasts and a little butter is used to sauté the garlic.
- **Dijon Mustard and Worcestershire**: Dijon mustard is of course the star of the show. Both Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce give the sauce the bulk of its flavor. The tanginess from the Dijon mixed with the savory umami flavor of the Worcestershire is a match made in heaven!
- **[Chicken Broth](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-chicken-broth/):** Chicken broth is used to help deglaze the pan, scrape up all of those flavorful brown bits, and is the base for the sauce.
- **Heavy Cream and Parmesan Cheese:** Just a little bit of heavy cream and parmesan cheese thickens the sauce and adds a luscious, creamy, rich flavor.
- **Spinach:** I added some spinach for extra greens and a little bit of color.
- **Seasoning:** The chicken breasts are seasoned with a blend of salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. This way every component of this dish is packed with flavor!

## **Can I Substitute Yellow Mustard For Dijon Mustard?**

I don’t recommend substituting Dijon mustard with yellow mustard. Dijon mustard has a more intense, sharp flavor that goes well with sauces compared to yellow mustard that has a milder, less complex flavor.

## **Not A Mustard Fan?**

I get it. But trust me this recipe is not super mustard-y and the flavors are balanced nicely. I tested this recipe a few times with different amounts of Dijon mustard. And I ended up with what I feel is the perfect combination. It’s just enough to taste the tangy, warm flavors of the Dijon, but not too much to where it overpowers the dish. You can always taste the sauce and add a little more mustard if you want a stronger Dijon taste.

## **Serving Suggestions**

We served this creamy dijon chicken over some fluffy [mashed potatoes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/mashed-potatoes/) to soak up all of that delicious sauce. But you can also serve it with some buttered noodles, pasta, or over [rice](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-cook-rice/). [A simple side salad](https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-a-simple-side-salad/) or [Caesar salad](https://www.budgetbytes.com/caesar-salad/) would also taste great. And you can never go wrong with a side of quick [sautéed vegetables](https://www.budgetbytes.com/simple-sauteed-vegetables/) like this easy [sautéed asparagus](https://www.budgetbytes.com/sauteed-asparagus/) recipe.
