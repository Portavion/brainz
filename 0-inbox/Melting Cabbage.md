# Marry Me Melting Cabbage Is So Tender, You Can Cut It with a Spoon
We gave Marry Me Chicken a vegetarian twist by replacing the traditional chicken with tender cabbage wedges, all coated in a rich and flavorful sun-dried tomato cream sauce. Sop up every last bit of sauce with a crusty hunk of whole-grain bread, or make it a main dish and serve it over brown rice or whole-wheat pasta.

## Ingredients

- 1 small head green cabbage (2¼ pounds​【1 kg】), outermost leaves removed
- ½ cup​【118 mL】 coarsely chopped drained julienne-cut sun-dried tomatoes in oil, plus 3 tablespoons oil from jar, divided
- 2¼ cups​【532 mL】 no-salt-added vegetable broth
- ¼ cup​【59 mL】 heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup​【59 mL】 reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed and softened
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons water
- ½ cup​【118 mL】 grated Parmesan cheese plus 1 tablespoon, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- Chopped fresh basil for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F​【177°C】. Slice cabbage in half through the root. Cut each half into 4 (about 2-inch-​【5 cm】thick) wedges, keeping core intact. Heat 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in a large, enamel-coated cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 cabbage wedges; cook until deeply browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side; transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and the remaining 4 cabbage wedges. Do not wipe the skillet clean.

2. Add ½ cup​【118 mL】 sun-dried tomatoes, 2¼ cups​【532 mL】 broth, ¼ cup cream, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1½ teaspoons Italian seasoning, ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, the minced garlic, the softened cream cheese, ¼ teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet; cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until well combined and boiling, about 2 minutes.

3. Stir 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 2 teaspoons water together in a small bowl until fully combined. Whisk into the mixture in the skillet; remove from heat. Whisk in ½ cup​【118 mL】 Parmesan until melted, about 1 minute.
4. Sprinkle the tops of the cabbage wedges with ¼ teaspoon pepper and the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt; nestle the wedges into the skillet, overlapping just slightly if needed to fit in a single layer.

5. Bake until the cabbage is fork-tender and the sauce has slightly thickened, 50 minutes to 1 hour, flipping the cabbage halfway through. Sprinkle the cabbage with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Garnish with basil, if desired.

This is a wonderful dish, and to the person who said it wasn't "vegetarian," you are mistaken. It's not "vegan," but it IS vegetarian. Learn what the words mean before making a negative comment & leaving a 1 star review. It's rude and ignorant.

I am not a huge fan of cabbage but this is a delicious recipe. My husband and I loved it. We had it with some grilled chicken and use baguette to dip into sauce. It's a great recipe. I will cut the cabbage to smaller chunks next time.

Delicious! I'm not fond of sun dried tomatoes but I enjoyed this recipe a lot. Easy to make too. We love garlic and added more, the only change I made. Eating Well always has very good recipes. To The Complainers: Cabbage is an extremely versatile, healthy vegetable; you obviously didn't make the recipe per your rude comments, so you don't get an opinion. Get a life. #Trolls

Looks great, it seems like the only negative reviews didn't make the dish so I figured I would review so I remember where I saw the recipe.I can tell I will love it, we eat a lot of cabbage but I've never made it with cream cheese. Sounds rich.

Love the umami from the sun dried tomatoes. The cabbage does get nice and melty while also retaining some of its integrity.
