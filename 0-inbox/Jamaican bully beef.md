Jamaican bully beef, also known as corned beef, is a beloved dish with roots tracing back to British colonial influences in Jamaica. During wartime, canned corned beef became a staple due to its affordability and long shelf-life, making it accessible for families across the island. Jamaicans transformed this preserved meat into a flavourful meal by sautéing it with onions, peppers and spices. Bully beef remains a comforting, quick-to-make dish, that is so nostalgic.
