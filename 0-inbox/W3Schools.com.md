## Python - Unpack Tuples

---

## Unpacking a Tuple

When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

### ExampleGet your own Python Server

Packing a tuple:

fruits = ( "apple", "banana", "cherry" )  

But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":

### Example

Unpacking a tuple:

fruits = ( "apple", "banana", "cherry" )  
  
(green, yellow, red) = fruits  
  
print (green)  
print (yellow)  
print (red)

**Note:** The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple, if not, you must use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list.

---

---

## Using Asterisk\*

If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an `*` to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:

### Example

Assign the rest of the values as a list called "red":

fruits = ( "apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry" )  
  
(green, yellow, \*red) = fruits  
  
print (green)  
print (yellow)  
print (red)

If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left.

### Example

Add a list of values the "tropic" variable:

fruits = ( "apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry" )  
  
(green, \*tropic, red) = fruits  
  
print (green)  
print (tropic)  
print (red)

---

## Exercise

Consider the following code:  
`fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')   (x, y, z) = fruits   print(y)`  
What will be the value of `y`?
