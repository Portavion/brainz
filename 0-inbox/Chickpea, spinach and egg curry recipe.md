## Ingredients

For *2* servings:
- 2 large free-range eggs
- 1 tbsp light olive oil
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds
- 2 tbsp medium curry powder, plus extra for sprinkling
- 1 tsp garlic granules
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 100ml boiling water
- 180g baby leaf spinach
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, to garnish
## Method

1. Bring a small saucepan of water to the boil and cook the eggs for 6–8 minutes, or until done to your liking. When cool enough to handle, shell, halve and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wide frying pan over a low heat. Add the cumin, black mustard seeds, curry powder, garlic granules and ground ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute.
3. Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, lemon juice and boiling water and season with salt and pepper. Cook over a high heat for 6–8 minutes, or until reduced and thickened, stirring often. Add the spinach and cook until wilted.
4. Divide the curry between two shallow bowls, top each with two egg halves and sprinkle over some curry powder. Scatter with coriander and serve immediately.
