When my college daughter shared a New York Times post about gochujang cookies, I was intrigued. The idea of using gochujang, a Korean chili paste, in cookies or any sweet dessert had never crossed my mind.

However, it made me think: if bacon can be a donut topping or transformed into jam, why not experiment with gochujang in cookies?

## Eric Kim’s Gochujang Caramel Cookies

These gochujang caramel cookies, introduced last year by [Eric Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B43W_wXJuY), a food columnist for the New York Times, initially sparked curiosity. But, much like many others, I was pleasantly surprised by their taste after trying them.

They boast a delightful texture, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, reminiscent of classic snickerdoodle cookies. The cookies feature a subtle hint of caramelized gochujang, adding a slight spicy note that cuts through the sweetness, balancing the flavors without being overwhelming.

Even my husband, who is a self-proclaimed cookie purist, was impressed. He enjoyed them so much that he suggested we make them for the Christmas cookie exchange party. Perhaps we will!

I am adding my own touch to Eric Kim’s cookie recipe, with a slightly different approach to making the dough. I also use an electric hand mixer instead of mixing by hand, to make the process easier.

## Korean Gochujang Paste

Gochujang is an essential Korean condiment, made from red chili peppers, glutinous rice, fermented soybeans, and salt. This fermented Korean red chili paste is spicy, slightly sweet, and full of umami flavor, making it a great fit for this unique gochujang sugar cookies recipe.

In Korean cuisine, gochujang is often used to add warmth and complex flavor. It’s a main ingredient in ‘[tteokbokki’](https://www.beyondkimchee.com/spicy-korean-rice-cakes/), a dish with spicy, sweet rice cakes, and in ‘[bibimbap](https://www.beyondkimchee.com/bibimbap/)‘, a mixed rice dish with vegetables and meat. Beyond these, it enhances stews, marinades, and sauces with its distinct Korean flavor.

With the growing trend of exploring diverse cuisines at home, finding gochujang has become more convenient. It’s typically available in the Asian section of your local supermarkets, Korean or Asian grocery stores, or through online retailers.

This recipe combines everyday pantry items with the unique addition of Korean chili paste. Here’s a breakdown of how each ingredient:

**Butter:** Provides richness and a soft texture. It also helps in creating a tender crumb in the cookies.  
Gochujang (Korean chili paste): The star ingredient! It adds a subtle heat and depth, complementing the sweetness of the sugars.

**Sugars (both white and brown):** White sugar adds sweetness and helps in achieving a crisp texture, while brown sugar imparts moisture and a slight molasses flavor.

**Egg:** Acts as a binder, giving structure to the cookies and contributing to their chewy texture.  
All-purpose flour: The base of the cookie dough, it provides structure and ensures the cookies hold their shape.

**Baking soda:** A leavening agent that helps the cookies rise and become fluffy.

**Salt:** Enhances the flavors and balances the sweetness.

**Cinnamon:** Adds a warm, spicy note that pairs beautifully with the gochujang.

**Vanilla extract:** Rounds out the flavors with its sweet, aromatic essence.
