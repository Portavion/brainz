## Goal 3: Consistent Music Creation & Release (Revised 12 Week Plan)
**Overall 12-Week Goal:** Establish a consistent music creation habit by producing one demo idea per week (12 total) and developing three of these demos into fully finished (written, produced, mixed, mastered) songs, releasing one song near the end of each month (Week 4, Week 8, Week 12).
**Key Performance Indicators (Track Weekly):**
- Demo Completed This Week (Y/N, Target: 1)
- Total Demos Completed
- Current Monthly Song Status (e.g., Structuring, Tracking, Mixing, Mastering, Released)
- Total Songs Finished/Released
- IG Content Posted This Week (Y/N, Target: 1)
- Execution Score (%) for Weekly Tactics

### Recurring Weekly Tactics (Perform Every Week, Weeks 1-12):
#### **1. Demo Creation:**
- **Activity:** Dedicated time for exploring new ideas, sketching song structures, recording basic chords/melodies/beats. Aim to capture the core essence of a new song idea.
- **Frequency:** **Complete 1 new demo sketch per week.** (Allocate specific time, e.g., 2 sessions x 60-90 minutes = 2-3 hours/week).
#### **2. Monthly Song Development:**
- **Activity:** Focused work on the _single demo selected_ for development during that specific month. This includes refining structure, writing lyrics, recording final parts, arranging, mixing, and mastering according to the monthly cycle.
- **Frequency:** **Dedicate ~7 hours per week** specifically to the designated monthly song. (e.g., 5 sessions x ~80-90 mins, or structure differently).
#### **3. Content Creation:**
- **Activity:** Prepare and share music-related content (clip of demo, snippet of song-in-progress, production tip, gear photo, etc.) on Instagram.
- **Frequency:** **Post 1 piece of content per week.**

### **Execution Notes:**
- **Time Blocking:** This goal requires significant scheduled time. Block out specific slots for "Demo Creation" and "Song Development" each week. Be disciplined.
- **Efficiency:** Finishing a song in ~4 weeks requires an efficient workflow. Template your sessions, reuse sounds/settings where appropriate, make decisions quickly, and avoid endless tweaking (especially in the demo stage).
- **Mastering:** DIY mastering is possible but challenging. Consider using online mastering services (like Landr, CloudBounce) or budgeting for a mastering engineer if quality is paramount â€“ factor this into your 4-week timeline.
- **Scope Management:** If you find the 4-week cycle too tight, be prepared to simplify. Maybe the "finished song" for a month is fully mixed but not mastered, or perhaps slightly less complex instrumentally. Adjust during your weekly review.
- **Weekly Review:** Absolutely critical for this demanding goal. Review:
    - Did you complete the demo?
    - Did you hit the target hours for song development? What stage is the song at?
    - Did you post content?
    - Score your execution. Are you keeping up? Is the quality acceptable?
    - Adjust next week's focus or session plan if needed. If you're falling behind on the monthly song, you might need to allocate slightly more time or simplify the arrangement.

This revised plan aligns with your desired workflow but demands high consistency and efficiency. Track your progress closely and adapt as needed!
