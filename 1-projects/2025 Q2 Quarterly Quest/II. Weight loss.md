**Assumptions for this Example Plan:**
- **Target Weight Realistic:** Assumes reaching 70kg (or the specified weight loss) is achievable in 12 weeks from your starting point. Adjust the goal if needed (e.g., "Lose 6kg towards 70kg target").
- **Strength Routine:** You will define specific routines for finger strength and/or climbing-related strength if you choose to include this optional tactic. Let's placeholder it as "[Defined Strength Routine]".

## Goal 2: Reach Target Weight and Improve Foundational Fitness (12 Week Plan)

**Overall 12-Week Goal:** Reach target weight of 70kg (or achieve specific weight loss target) by consistently applying planned nutrition and exercise habits, improving cardiovascular fitness and flexibility along the way.

**Key Performance Indicators (Track Weekly):**
- Weekly Average Weight (measure 2-3 times/week, average it)
- Weekly Average Calorie Intake
- Weekly Average Daily Steps
- Total Km Run This Week
- Flexibility Progress (e.g., distance to toes, subjective feeling)
- Execution Score (%) for Weekly Tactics
---
### Recurring Weekly Tactics (Perform Every Week, Weeks 1-12):
#### **1. Calorie Tracking:**
- **Activity:** Log all food and drink consumed daily using your chosen app/method. Aim for consistency and accuracy.
- **Frequency:** **Daily Tracking**, maintain **≤ 10,500 kcal weekly average** (approx. 1500 kcal/day).
#### **2. Daily Movement:**
- **Activity:** Actively seek opportunities to walk/move throughout the day (walk breaks, stairs, dedicated walks). Monitor using a tracker.
- **Frequency:** Achieve **average 8,000 steps per day**.
#### **3. Cardio:**
- **Activity:** Perform running sessions. Focus on completing the distance consistently.
- **Frequency:** **Total 15km per week** (e.g., scheduled as 3 x 5km runs, or other distribution).
#### **4. Flexibility:**
- **Activity:** Perform your defined 20-minute stretching/mobility routine, focusing on major muscle groups and areas needed for climbing/toe-touching.
- **Frequency:** **3 times per week** (on scheduled days, perhaps after runs or strength work).
#### **5. Strength/Climbing Prep (Optional):**
- **Activity:** Perform your [Defined Strength Routine(s)] focusing on proper form.
- **Frequency:** **2 times per week** (on scheduled days, allow rest between sessions).

### **Week-by-Week Breakdown:**
_Note: For this goal, most 'tasks' are the consistent execution of the recurring tactics. Week 1 includes specific setup actions._
#### **Week 1: Setup & Baseline**
- [x] **Setup:** Set up calorie tracking app/method (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Cronometer).
- [x] **Setup:** Plan your typical running schedule for the week (days/times).
- [x] **Setup:** Define your specific 20-minute flexibility routine (list of stretches, duration).
- [ ] **Setup (Optional):** Define your specific strength/finger training routine(s) if including.
- [x] **Setup:** Take starting measurements: Weight (average over 2-3 days if possible), body measurements (optional), 'before' photos (optional), flexibility benchmark (e.g., measure distance to toes).
- [ ] **Execute:** Perform all recurring tactics for the first time. Focus on establishing the routine.
#### **Week 2: Building Consistency**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 1 KPIs (Weight trend, average calories/steps/km, flexibility). Did you hit your tactic targets? What challenges arose?
- [ ] **Focus:** Pay attention to hunger cues and ensure adequate hydration.
#### **Week 3: Routine Integration**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 2 KPIs. Are trends moving in the right direction? Adjust calorie target slightly _only if necessary_ and sustainable.
- [ ] **Focus:** Integrate the activities smoothly into your weekly schedule. Try prepping healthy snacks/meals.
#### **Week 4: Monitoring Progress**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 3 KPIs. Notice changes in fitness (running pace/effort, flexibility ease).
- [ ] **Focus:** Ensure step count is consistently met – perhaps add a short evening walk if needed.
#### **Week 5: Overcoming Plateaus (if any)**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 4 KPIs. If weight loss stalls for >1 week, double-check calorie tracking accuracy or consider a _very slight_ increase in activity (e.g., 8500 steps).
- [ ] **Focus:** Maintain motivation. Try a new running route or healthy recipe.
#### **Week 6: Halfway Checkpoint**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 5 KPIs and overall progress since Week 1. Are you on track for the 12-week goal? Celebrate progress made!
- [ ] **Focus:** Push slightly deeper in stretches (if comfortable) during flexibility routines.
#### **Week 7: Maintaining Momentum**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 6 KPIs. Address any recurring challenges identified in weekly reviews.
- [ ] **Focus:** Listen to your body – ensure adequate rest/recovery, especially if doing strength work.
#### **Week 8: Enhancing Habits**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 7 KPIs. Note improvements in running endurance or strength.
- [ ] **Focus:** Think about food quality within calorie goals – prioritize whole foods.
#### **Week 9: Consistency is Key**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 8 KPIs. How is flexibility progressing towards the 'touch toes' aim?
- [ ] **Focus:** Reinforce the habits. Don't let small slip-ups derail the week.
#### **Week 10: Nearing the Finish Line**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 9 KPIs. Are you close to the target weight? How do you feel physically?
- [ ] **Focus:** Consider planning for maintaining habits beyond the 12 weeks.
#### **Week 11: Final Push**
- [ ] **Review:** Check Week 10 KPIs. Make final minor adjustments if needed.
- [ ] **Focus:** Stay diligent with tracking and execution.
#### **Week 12: Final Review & Future Planning**
- [ ] **Review:** Check final KPIs (Weight, average calories/steps/km, flexibility). Assess achievement of the 12-week goal. Take 'after' photos/measurements (optional).
- [ ] **Plan:** Decide on maintenance goals or the next 12-week goals related to fitness (e.g., focus more on strength, increase running distance, set a climbing V-grade goal).

### **Execution Notes:**
- **Time Blocking:** Schedule your runs, flexibility sessions, and strength workouts in your calendar. Plan roughly when you'll get your steps in. Meal prep can save time on calorie tracking during busy days.
- **Weekly Review:** This is crucial for Goal 2. Use your Friday/Monday review slot to:
    - Calculate your weekly averages (calories, steps).
    - Log your weight trend and total km run.
    - Score your execution for each tactic (Did I track calories daily? Did I hit 15km? etc.).
    - Assess progress towards the 70kg goal and flexibility aim.
    - Identify what worked, what didn't, and adjust next week's _approach_ if needed (e.g., "Need to pack healthy snacks to avoid afternoon temptation," "Schedule runs for mornings as evenings were too busy").
- **Listen to Your Body:** Don't push through sharp pain. Allow for rest and recovery. Adjust intensity if needed, but strive to maintain consistency in the habits.
- **Non-Linear Progress:** Weight loss isn't always linear. Focus on the _consistent execution_ of your tactics – the results will follow over time.
