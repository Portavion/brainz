## Original Prompt
**Refined 12 Week Year Plan:**
**Goal 1: Secure a High-Quality Coding Job Interview Pipeline**
- **Original:** Find a coding job (Outcome)
- **Refined 12-Week Goal:** Generate consistent interview opportunities by demonstrating strong technical skills and portfolio projects. (Focuses on the process within the 12 weeks).
- **Key Performance Indicators (Lag Measures - check weekly):** # Applications Sent, # Responses Received, # Interviews Scheduled, # Leetcode Problems Completed, Project Milestones Met.
- **Weekly Tactics (Lead Measures - execute these):**
    1. **Job Applications:** Apply to 15 _targeted_ developer roles per week. (Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented)
    2. **Algorithm Practice:** Complete 5 Leetcode problems per week (e.g., 2 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard). Track topics covered. (Specific, Measurable)
    3. **Focused Learning (Choose ONE language to prioritize for job hunting initially):** Dedicate 5 hours per week to focused [Python/OOP _or_ Go] practice, working through specific exercises or tutorials (e.g., complete X modules of a course, build Y small exercises). _Be specific about the resource or project._
    4. **Portfolio Project (Choose ONE main project to focus on):** Dedicate 8 hours per week specifically to developing and documenting your chosen priority project ([Chalkr App _or_ Velock _or_ Streamtostream]). Define mini-milestones for each week (e.g., Week 1: Setup & Auth, Week 2: Core Feature X, Week 3: Testing for Feature X...). _Finishing might be the 12-week goal, but the tactic is the consistent weekly hours._
    5. **Conceptual Learning:** Read/Study [Specific Book/Resource, e.g., "Clean Code"] for 30 minutes, 5 days per week.
    6. **Networking/Visibility (Optional but recommended):** Engage in 1 networking activity per week (e.g., attend online meetup, contribute to an open-source issue, comment thoughtfully on relevant LinkedIn posts).
- **Initial Tasks (Week 1):**
    - Finalize and polish CV.
    - Create a customizable, high-quality Cover Letter template.
    - Select the primary language focus (Python or Go) for the 12 weeks.
    - Select the primary portfolio project focus.
    - Select the primary coding book/resource.
    - Set up tracking for Leetcode problems.

**Execution Notes:**

- **Time Blocking:** Schedule specific time slots for each recurring tactic and the weekly project/learning work. Protect this time.
- **Weekly Review:** The most critical part. Every week, review:
    - Your execution score on the tactics.
    - Progress on KPIs (apps sent, responses, interviews).
    - Whether you met the week's specific milestones (project, learning).
    - Adjust next week's plan if necessary (e.g., if a project milestone took longer, adjust the following week's scope).
- **Flexibility:** This is a template. If you finish a milestone early, pull the next one forward. If you get stuck, adjust the plan during your weekly review. If you get an interview, dedicate extra time that week to preparation.

This detailed plan provides structure and clear weekly targets to drive consistent progress towards your job search goal. Good luck!
