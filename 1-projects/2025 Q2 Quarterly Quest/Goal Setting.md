**Core 12 Week Year Principles Applied:**
1. **Vision:** While not explicitly asked for, remember your 12-week goals should align with a longer-term vision (e.g., thriving as a developer, being healthy and fit, expressing creativity through music). Keep that "why" in mind.
2. **Lead vs. Lag Indicators:** Focus your weekly plan on _actions_ you control (lead indicators like 'apply to 15 jobs') rather than just the _outcomes_ (lag indicators like 'get a job'). The outcomes are the _goals_, the actions are the _tactics_.
3. **Time-Blocking:** Plan _when_ you will execute your tactics.
4. **Weekly Review & Scoring:** This is crucial. Each week, you'll score your execution on the planned tactics (% completed) and review your progress towards the goals (lag indicators).

**Goal 2: Reach Target Weight and Improve Foundational Fitness**
- **Original:** Lose weight (70kg), climbing V7, running 15km, touch toes. (Mix of outcomes and actions)
- **Refined 12-Week Goal:** Reach target weight of 70kg through consistent nutrition and exercise habits. (Specific, Measurable Outcome). _Ensure 70kg is realistic from your starting point in 12 weeks. If it's a large drop, the goal might be "Lose X kg towards 70kg target"._
- **Key Performance Indicators (Lag Measures - check weekly):** Weekly Weight, Weekly Average Calories, Weekly Average Steps, Total Km Run, Subjective flexibility measure (e.g., distance from toes).
- **Weekly Tactics (Lead Measures - execute these):**
    1. **Calorie Tracking:** Track daily food intake and maintain a weekly average calorie intake of 10,500 kcal (1500 kcal/day average). (Specific, Measurable)
    2. **Daily Movement:** Achieve an average of 8,000 steps per day. (Specific, Measurable)
    3. **Cardio:** Complete 15km of running per week (e.g., distributed as 3 x 5km runs). (Specific, Measurable)
    4. **Flexibility:** Perform a dedicated 20-minute stretching/mobility routine 3 times per week. (Specific, Measurable - focus on consistency, the 'touching toes' is the result).
    5. **Strength/Climbing Prep (Optional - if capacity allows, supports fitness):** Complete [Specific finger strength routine] 2 times per week _AND/OR_ [Specific climbing-related strength workout] 2 times per week. _Be precise about the routine._
- **Initial Tasks (Week 1):**
    - Set up calorie tracking app/method.
    - Plan your typical running schedule.
    - Define your specific flexibility routine.
    - Define your specific strength/finger training routines (if including).
    - Take starting measurements (Weight, photos, flexibility benchmark).
**Goal 3: Complete and Release One New Song**
- **Original:** Release a new song, daily sessions, demo a week, IG content, finish song a month. (Slightly conflicting/unfocused actions).
- **Refined 12-Week Goal:** Write, produce, mix, master, and release one specific song by the end of the 12 weeks. (Clear, Specific Outcome)
- **Key Performance Indicators (Lag Measures - check weekly):** Song % Complete (based on defined stages), Demo Status, Content Posted, Weekly Milestone Achieved.
- **Weekly Tactics (Lead Measures - execute these):**
    1. **Focused Production Time:** Dedicate 60 minutes, 5 days per week, _specifically_ to working on the target song (writing, recording, arranging, sound design, mixing).
    2. **Weekly Milestone:** Define and achieve one specific, tangible milestone for the target song each week. (Examples: Week 1: Chord Progression & Structure Lock; Week 2: Record main vocal; Week 3: Program Drums; Week 4: Mix Bass & Drums...). _This forces progress._
    3. **Content Creation:** Create and post 1 piece of music-related content (e.g., short clip, production insight, process photo/video) on Instagram per week.
    4. **Idea Generation (Optional - if capacity allows):** Dedicate 1 separate session (e.g., 30-60 mins) per week purely for sketching new song ideas/demos (not the main track).
- **Initial Tasks (Week 1):**
    - Select the specific song idea/demo to develop for the 12 weeks.
    - Outline the major stages of the song's production (writing, tracking, mixing, mastering, release prep).
    - Create a rough 12-week milestone plan based on these stages.
    - Set up project file/session.
**Putting It All Together - The 12 Week Year Execution:**
1. **Plan Your Week:** At the start of each week (e.g., Sunday evening), schedule specific blocks of time in your calendar for _every single tactic_. Treat these appointments with yourself as seriously as any other commitment.
2. **Execute Daily/Weekly:** Focus on completing the scheduled tactics.
3. **Weekly Accountability Meeting (WAM):** Dedicate 1-2 hours _at the same time each week_ (e.g., Friday afternoon or Monday morning) to:
    - **Score Your Execution:** Calculate your percentage score for completing last week's tactics (e.g., if you had 15 planned tactic instances and completed 13, your score is 13/15 = 87%). Aim for 85%+.
    - **Review Results (Lag Indicators):** Check your weight, number of interviews, song progress etc. Are the actions leading to the desired results?
    - **Identify What Worked/What Didn't:** Analyze _why_ you hit or missed tactics.
    - **Adjust & Plan:** Refine next week's tactics or schedule based on your review. Recommit to your goals.
4. **Keep Score:** Track your execution scores and key results week over week. This data is vital for making adjustments.
**Important Considerations:**
- **Realism:** This is an ambitious plan across three distinct domains. Be honest about your time and energy capacity. It's better to choose fewer tactics and execute them consistently (85%+) than to plan too much and only achieve 50%. Don't be afraid to scale back slightly if needed after the first week or two.
- **Prioritization:** If time gets tight, which goal takes precedence? Knowing this in advance helps make tough choices.
- **Buffers:** Schedule some buffer time in your week for unexpected issues or rest.
- **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge progress each week during your review!
This refined structure gives you clear, actionable steps for each week, focusing your effort on the activities most likely to drive results towards your 12-week goals. Good luck!
