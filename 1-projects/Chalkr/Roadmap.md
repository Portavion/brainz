To build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for your climbing app, it's important to prioritize features and implement them in a logical order. This ensures you deliver core functionality quickly while leaving room for iteration and improvement. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing your MVP:

---

### **1. Define MVP Scope**

Before starting, clearly define the core features of your MVP. For your climbing app, the MVP might include:

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Workout Logging**: Log boulders and grades.
- **Offline Support**: Save data locally using SQLite.
- **Data Syncing**: Sync local data with the backend when online.
- **Basic Stats**: Display simple climbing statistics (e.g., total climbs, grades distribution).
- **Backend API**: Store data in PostgreSQL and provide APIs for syncing.

---

### **2. Implementation Order**

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Project**

- **Frontend**: Initialize a React Native project with Expo.
    
    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app climbing-app
    ```
    
- **Backend**: Set up an Express server.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir backend && cd backend
    npm init -y
    npm install express pg
    ```
    

---

#### **Step 2: Implement User Authentication**

- **Frontend**:
    - Integrate Firebase Auth for sign-up, login, and user management.
    - Use Firebase SDK to handle authentication flows.
- **Backend**:
    - Create an endpoint to verify Firebase tokens and manage user sessions.

**Why First?** Authentication is foundational. Most features depend on knowing who the user is.

---

#### **Step 3: Build the Local Database (SQLite)**

- **Frontend**:
    - Set up SQLite for offline data storage.
    - Create tables for workouts and user data.
    - Implement functions to save and retrieve data locally.
- **Backend**:
    - No backend changes needed at this stage.

**Why Next?** Offline functionality is a core feature. Users should be able to log workouts even without internet.

---

#### **Step 4: Implement Workout Logging**

- **Frontend**:
    - Create a form to log boulders (e.g., date, grade, location).
    - Save workouts to SQLite.
    - Display a list of logged workouts.
- **Backend**:
    - No backend changes needed yet.

**Why Next?** Workout logging is the primary user interaction. It should be simple and functional.

---

#### **Step 5: Set Up the Backend Database (PostgreSQL)**

- **Backend**:
    - Set up a PostgreSQL database.
    - Create tables for users, workouts, and other necessary data.
    - Write scripts for database migrations and seeding.
- **Frontend**:
    - No frontend changes needed yet.

**Why Next?** The backend database is needed for syncing and storing data long-term.

---

#### **Step 6: Implement Data Syncing**

- **Backend**:
    - Create APIs for syncing data (e.g., `/sync/workouts`).
    - Handle conflict resolution (e.g., last-write-wins or merging changes).
- **Frontend**:
    - Detect when the user is online.
    - Sync local data with the backend using the APIs.

**Why Next?** Syncing ensures data consistency across devices and provides a seamless user experience.

---

#### **Step 7: Add Basic Stats**

- **Frontend**:
    - Calculate and display simple statistics (e.g., total climbs, grades distribution).
    - Use a charting library (e.g., Victory Native) to visualize data.
- **Backend**:
    - No backend changes needed unless you want to calculate stats server-side.

**Why Next?** Stats provide value to users and make the app more engaging.

---

#### **Step 8: Polish and Test**

- **Frontend**:
    - Improve the UI/UX (e.g., add loading states, error handling).
    - Write unit and integration tests for components and hooks.
    - Write E2E tests for critical user flows (e.g., logging a workout, syncing data).
- **Backend**:
    - Write unit and integration tests for APIs and database interactions.
    - Test the backend with tools like Postman or Supertest.

**Why Last?** Polishing and testing ensure the app is stable and user-friendly.

### **3. Example Timeline**

Here’s a rough timeline for implementing the MVP:

| **Week** | **Tasks** |  
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Week 1 | Set up project, implement Firebase Auth, and build SQLite local database. |  
| Week 2 | Implement workout logging and basic UI for logging and viewing workouts. |  
| Week 3 | Set up PostgreSQL, create backend APIs, and implement data syncing. |  
| Week 4 | Add basic stats, polish the UI, and write tests. |

---

### **4. Tools and Libraries**

Here’s a recap of the tools and libraries you’ll use:

- **Frontend**:
    - React Native, Expo, Firebase Auth, SQLite, Victory Native.
- **Backend**:
    - Express, PostgreSQL, Firebase Admin SDK.
- **Testing**:
    - Jest, React Testing Library, Detox, Supertest.

---

### **5. Deliver the MVP**

Once the core features are implemented and tested, release the MVP to a small group of users for feedback. Use their input to prioritize improvements and additional features (e.g., social features, advanced stats, or gamification).

---

### **Conclusion**

By following this order, you can deliver a functional MVP quickly and iteratively. Start with authentication and offline functionality, then add syncing and stats. Focus on core features first, and leave advanced features for future updates. This approach ensures you build a solid foundation while keeping the scope manageable.
