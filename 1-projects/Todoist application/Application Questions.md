## **What are the two professional/career highlights you’re most proud of? Why?**


## **What’s one technical skill, not mentioned in the job ad, that you consider yourself to be very strong in? How would you use it at Doist?**

**2. System Optimization and Problem Solving**

- **What it is (for you):** Transport modelling is fundamentally about optimizing a complex system (a road network, a public transit system). You're constantly trying to find the best solution given constraints (budget, space, environmental impact). You're used to thinking about trade-offs, iterative improvements, and the knock-on effects of changes. LinSig, in particular, is all about optimizing signal timings to minimize delays. This involves a systematic approach to problem-solving.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "A key technical skill I bring is system optimization and iterative problem-solving. My background in transport modelling is centered around finding the most efficient solutions within a complex system. I'm used to working with constraints, evaluating trade-offs, and iteratively refining a design to achieve a specific goal, whether that's minimizing journey times in a city or maximizing the throughput of a junction. This involves a methodical approach to identifying bottlenecks, testing hypotheses, and validating results."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "At Doist, I could apply this optimization mindset to the Todoist web app itself. I could analyze user workflows to identify areas of friction or inefficiency. For instance, if data shows users frequently abandon a particular task creation process, I could use my problem-solving skills to diagnose the issue, propose UI/UX changes, and then test those changes to see if they improve the user experience. My focus would be on making the app as smooth and efficient as possible for users."
**. Model Calibration and Validation (A Scientific Approach to Software)**

- **What it is (for you):** A core part of transport modelling is calibrating and validating your models. This is a rigorous process of comparing model outputs to real-world observations (traffic counts, travel times, etc.), adjusting model parameters, and iterating until the model accurately reflects reality. This requires a systematic, data-driven approach, a strong understanding of statistical significance, and the ability to identify and diagnose discrepancies. It's essentially a scientific method applied to a simulation.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "One technical strength I bring is expertise in model calibration and validation. In transport modelling, it's crucial to ensure that the simulation accurately reflects real-world conditions. I'm experienced in the iterative process of comparing model outputs to observed data, identifying discrepancies, adjusting parameters, and statistically validating the model's performance. This is essentially a scientific approach, requiring careful data analysis, attention to detail, and a methodical approach to problem-solving."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "This calibration and validation mindset is directly transferable to software development, particularly in testing and quality assurance. I can apply this systematic approach to evaluate the performance of the Todoist web app, identify bugs or areas for improvement, and ensure that new features meet performance and usability goals. My experience with validation would be valuable in designing and executing tests, analyzing results, and ensuring the overall quality and reliability of the software."
**8. Abstraction and Conceptual Modeling**

- **What it is (for you):** Transport modelling _is_ abstraction. You're taking a complex, messy real-world system (a city's transportation network) and representing it in a simplified, manageable form. You're making decisions about what to include, what to exclude, and what level of detail is appropriate. You're translating real-world observations into mathematical relationships and algorithmic rules. This requires strong conceptual modeling skills – the ability to take a complex system and create a useful, simplified representation of it.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "A core technical skill I possess is abstraction and conceptual modeling. Transport modelling is fundamentally about creating simplified, yet representative, models of complex real-world systems. I'm skilled at identifying the essential elements of a transport network, translating those elements into a mathematical and algorithmic representation, and understanding the limitations of that abstraction. This involves making informed decisions about the level of detail required and the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "This ability to abstract and model complex systems is highly relevant to software development. When designing a new feature for Todoist, or even when refactoring existing code, I can apply this conceptual modeling skill to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components. I can create clear and concise representations of the system's architecture, data flow, and user interactions. This helps in understanding the bigger picture, identifying potential bottlenecks, and designing elegant and efficient solutions. It’s about seeing the forest _and_ the trees."

### Chalkr
This is an ios app that I built in order to help track my climbing sessions and do some interesting data analysis. I am also a pretty keen runner and I love to dive into all the stats and graphs you can get with running app (say garmin) Unfortunately I've not found anything that translate to climbing. I didn't not find anything that provided much insights into climbing training. I wanted to build something that is user friendly and effortlessly allows to track climbing sessions, log problems with all their relevant characteristics, including a photo of the route. Then process all that data to get some good insights into my climbing. For example, I know I am relatively bad at resting sufficient time in between attempts so being able to visualise how much time I spend on and off the wall is valuable. I also tend to jump onto harder problems to quickly and
