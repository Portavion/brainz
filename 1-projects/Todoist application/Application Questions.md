## **What are the two professional/career highlights you’re most proud of? Why?**


## **What’s one technical skill, not mentioned in the job ad, that you consider yourself to be very strong in? How would you use it at Doist?**

**2. System Optimization and Problem Solving**

- **What it is (for you):** Transport modelling is fundamentally about optimizing a complex system (a road network, a public transit system). You're constantly trying to find the best solution given constraints (budget, space, environmental impact). You're used to thinking about trade-offs, iterative improvements, and the knock-on effects of changes. LinSig, in particular, is all about optimizing signal timings to minimize delays. This involves a systematic approach to problem-solving.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "A key technical skill I bring is system optimization and iterative problem-solving. My background in transport modelling is centered around finding the most efficient solutions within a complex system. I'm used to working with constraints, evaluating trade-offs, and iteratively refining a design to achieve a specific goal, whether that's minimizing journey times in a city or maximizing the throughput of a junction. This involves a methodical approach to identifying bottlenecks, testing hypotheses, and validating results."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "At Doist, I could apply this optimization mindset to the Todoist web app itself. I could analyze user workflows to identify areas of friction or inefficiency. For instance, if data shows users frequently abandon a particular task creation process, I could use my problem-solving skills to diagnose the issue, propose UI/UX changes, and then test those changes to see if they improve the user experience. My focus would be on making the app as smooth and efficient as possible for users."
**. Model Calibration and Validation (A Scientific Approach to Software)**

- **What it is (for you):** A core part of transport modelling is calibrating and validating your models. This is a rigorous process of comparing model outputs to real-world observations (traffic counts, travel times, etc.), adjusting model parameters, and iterating until the model accurately reflects reality. This requires a systematic, data-driven approach, a strong understanding of statistical significance, and the ability to identify and diagnose discrepancies. It's essentially a scientific method applied to a simulation.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "One technical strength I bring is expertise in model calibration and validation. In transport modelling, it's crucial to ensure that the simulation accurately reflects real-world conditions. I'm experienced in the iterative process of comparing model outputs to observed data, identifying discrepancies, adjusting parameters, and statistically validating the model's performance. This is essentially a scientific approach, requiring careful data analysis, attention to detail, and a methodical approach to problem-solving."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "This calibration and validation mindset is directly transferable to software development, particularly in testing and quality assurance. I can apply this systematic approach to evaluate the performance of the Todoist web app, identify bugs or areas for improvement, and ensure that new features meet performance and usability goals. My experience with validation would be valuable in designing and executing tests, analyzing results, and ensuring the overall quality and reliability of the software."
**8. Abstraction and Conceptual Modeling**

- **What it is (for you):** Transport modelling _is_ abstraction. You're taking a complex, messy real-world system (a city's transportation network) and representing it in a simplified, manageable form. You're making decisions about what to include, what to exclude, and what level of detail is appropriate. You're translating real-world observations into mathematical relationships and algorithmic rules. This requires strong conceptual modeling skills – the ability to take a complex system and create a useful, simplified representation of it.
- **How it's phrased in the interview:** "A core technical skill I possess is abstraction and conceptual modeling. Transport modelling is fundamentally about creating simplified, yet representative, models of complex real-world systems. I'm skilled at identifying the essential elements of a transport network, translating those elements into a mathematical and algorithmic representation, and understanding the limitations of that abstraction. This involves making informed decisions about the level of detail required and the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost."
- **How you'd use it at Doist:** "This ability to abstract and model complex systems is highly relevant to software development. When designing a new feature for Todoist, or even when refactoring existing code, I can apply this conceptual modeling skill to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components. I can create clear and concise representations of the system's architecture, data flow, and user interactions. This helps in understanding the bigger picture, identifying potential bottlenecks, and designing elegant and efficient solutions. It’s about seeing the forest _and_ the trees."
## **Can you please share links to projects that you're proud of? These could include apps, portfolios, a GitHub profile and/or anything else that showcases your best work. (optional/can be replaced)**

### Chalkr
This is an ios app that I built in order to help track my climbing sessions and do some interesting data analysis. Here is a link to the github repo: https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr Here is a link to a quick demo I've recorded as I've not gone through the process off uploading it to the App store yet: https://youtube.com/shorts/XcV6ChUhr9Q?feature=share

I am also a pretty keen runner and I love to dive into all the stats and graphs you can get with running app (say garmin) Unfortunately I've not found anything that translate to climbing. I didn't not find anything that provided much insights into climbing training. I wanted to build something that is user friendly and effortlessly allows to track climbing sessions, log problems with all their relevant characteristics, including a photo of the route. Then process all that data to get some good insights into my climbing. For example, I know I am relatively bad at resting sufficient time in between attempts so being able to visualise how much time I spend on and off the wall is valuable. I also tend to jump onto harder problems to quickly and expedite warmup so I've built a graph that visually allows me to see how I ramp up difficulty during a training. 

### Velock
I've built this mobile first web app because I was a little frustrated with Santander's own cycle app. While you can save favourite station you can't build list to allow to check for specific stations depending on the context. Their search is also very hit and miss when using an address. 

I've built a quick web app that allows me to create different list with their own subset of stations so I can quickly check stations near home, our stations near my office / gyms at a glance. Here is a link to the github repo that holds both backend and frontend: https://github.com/Portavion/velock/tree/main It also has a quick demo showing the interface.

It's powered with Transport for London open API, for my search feature I've leveraged open street map geocoding api and the postGIS extension for postreSQL which gives me much more consistent results than Santander.

### Draft
I'm really excited by the idea of using tech to solve everyday problems (especially my owns). I've got a couple of side projects I'm excited to share that I think showcase this: 

First an iOS climbing app called Chalkr which I am currently working on. 
GitHub: [https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr](https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr) 
Demo: [https://youtube.com/shorts/XcV6ChUhr9Q?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/XcV6ChUhr9Q?feature=share) 

I recently got into bouldering and I'm also a bit of a data geek. I love digging into stats to see how I can improve. I noticed most climbing apps were pretty basic when it came to real training insights when you compared to other apps like Strava and Garmin for running. I wanted something that would let me see what I was doing in my sessions and how my skills are improving. The app lets you easily log every climb – you can even snap a picture of the route and add all the relevant stats.  It tracks how long you're actually climbing on the wall versus resting.Which confirmed I was really bad at taking proper rests... It shows you how you ramp up the difficulty during a session. This helps me make sure I'm warming up properly and not jumping on hard stuff too soon and other usefull stats. * All the data is stored locally on the phone [or specify if you used a different solution]. * 

**How I Built It:** * I used React Native and Expo, which was a great way to build for iOS quickly. * I got to play around with creating custom components to display the data in a way that made sense for climbers. * One challenge was [mention a *specific* technical challenge, e.g., "figuring out how to efficiently store and retrieve image data," or "making the UI feel really smooth even with lots of data points"]. I solved it by [briefly explain your solution]. 

**2. Velock (London Bike Availability Checker - Web App)** * **GitHub:** [https://github.com/Portavion/velock/tree/main](https://github.com/Portavion/velock/tree/main) * **Demo:** [Link to your demo, ideally hosted live] *[Seriously consider deploying this]* I use the Santander Cycles in London *all the time*, but their app was driving me nuts! You can save favorite stations, but you can't organize them. And trying to search for a station by address was often a total failure. I figured there had to be a better way. * **What it Does:** * You can create custom lists of stations – I have one for "Near Home," "Near Work," "Near the Gym," etc. Makes it super quick to check availability. * The search is *way* better. I used OpenStreetMap's geocoding API and PostGIS, which is a spatial extension for PostgreSQL. It's much more accurate than the official app. * It pulls real-time bike availability data from the TfL Open API. * **How I Built It:** * I used [Specify your backend technology] for the backend API. * The frontend is built with [Specify your frontend framework]. * It was fun getting to work with multiple APIs and integrate them into a single app. * [Mention a *specific* technical challenge, e.g., "Handling rate limits from the TfL API," or "Designing the database to efficiently handle spatial queries"]. I tackled this by [briefly explain your solution]. These projects really show how I like to combine my technical skills with my interests to build things that are actually useful. I'm excited about the possibility of bringing that same approach to Doist, building tools that help people be more productive and organized.
