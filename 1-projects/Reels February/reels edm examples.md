**Original Script:** _Getting an underground melodic techno weapon that is also interesting to hear outside a club setting. Taking the song from this production mix… to this final mix.  
When I first listen to the project I instantly knew I had to retain the lush and spacious sound design. I processed everything in a way that would gel all the layers together and create new and interesting sonic textures.  
I also loved that old school techno percussion bassline and wanted to have each individual hits be felt in the chest and contrast with the deep kick to get a final result that is groovy and punchy._

**Shortened Script:** “For this mix I wanted to enhance the punch of the old school tom bassline while enhancing the rich, lush textures of the layered synths lead.”

**Original Script:** _Making this emotional techno track sound big, raw and ethereal. Going from this rough mix … to this final master…  
The original production had this big, heavy reese bass and beautiful, emotional swells acting as the lead. For the mix, we decided to double down on the bass layering doing a combination of mid /side and left / right processing to really enhance the width whilst conserving the low-end energy in the centre. Kind of unconventional but it worked so well her for…_

**Shortened Script:** “In this mix I’ve used lots of layering with different mid /side and left / right processing create this bigger than life Reese bass while preserving the low-end energy in the centre.”

**Original Script:** _This mix was all about retaining and enhancing the interesting texture of the flamenco guitars from the lead. From this rough mix … to this final mix …_

_I’ve added multiples washes of delay going in and out to create a surreal space. I’ve also done some automation work with a heavy parallel bus with chorus / bit crushing and other FX to move from recognisable guitar strums to textural pads. An amazing exemple of where mixing can flirt with production when the artists get more involved._ 

**Shortened Script:** This mix was all about retaining the unique texture of the flamenco guitars. I’ve added washes of delay to create a surreal space. I've also used a parallel bus with chorus, bit crushing, and other effects to transform the guitar strums into textural pads. A great example of how mixing can blur the lines with production when the artist is deeply involved.
