## Kamaliza - The Oracle
Getting clean and real punchy drums with those airy vocals for that modern RnB sound. For this master I started from an incredible mix from Grammy nominated mixing engineer Kevin McCloskey. I wanted to keep the punch the drums without introducing distortion on the master to keep that clean and crisp modern RnB sound. The production also featured some beautiful strings that I wanted to enhance the width of to get a bigger soundstage that envelops you
