## Kamaliza - The Oracle
Getting clean and real punchy drums with those airy vocals for that modern RnB sound. For this master I started from an incredible mix from Grammy nominated mixing engineer Kevin McCloskey. I wanted to keep the punch the drums without introducing distortion on the master to keep that clean and crisp modern RnB sound. The production also featured some beautiful strings that I wanted to enhance the width of to get a wider soundstage that envelops the listener.

This master is all about that modern RnB vibe - punchy drums. airy vocal. Starting from an incredible mix from grammy nominated engineer Kevin McCloskey I kept the punch of the drums without introducing additional distortion that might interfere with the airy vocal. I also widened the strings for a truly immersive listening experience. Check out the final track...
## Tyler Loyal - Ferrari
Modern, crisp, airy RnB vocals done right. With this master I wanted to enhance those crystal clear vocals from Tyler using a combination of saturation and EQing to enhance the air and sparkle without introducing harshness for that creamy vocal sound. Shoutout to Kevin McCloskey for the dope mix.
## Soul Baby Dali - Pull Out
For this master, we focused on EQing to clean up the low end / low midrange of the track to open up the vocal getting some of that modern airy vocal sound while tightening up the drums for a pronounced knock. The result is a polished, radio-ready sound
## WSK Breezy - 
This prod from WSK Breezy featured some crazy deep 808 hits that I wanted to enhance in the master for that sub impact that hits you in the guts while cleaning up the midrange to bring out some additional defition to those airy vocals.
## Mokey - Petty Theft
