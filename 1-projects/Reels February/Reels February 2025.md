## Kamaliza - The Oracle
Getting clean and real punchy drums with those airy vocals for that modern RnB sound. For this master I started from an incredible mix from Grammy nominated mixing engineer Kevin McCloskey. I wanted to keep the punch the drums without introducing distortion on the master to keep that clean and crisp modern RnB sound. The production also featured some beautiful strings that I wanted to enhance the width of to get a wider soundstage that envelops the listener.

This master is all about that modern RnB vibe - punchy drums. airy vocal. Starting from an incredible mix from grammy nominated engineer Kevin McCloskey I kept the punch of the drums without introducing additional distortion that might interfere with the airy vocal. I also widened the strings for a truly immersive listening experience. Check out the final track...
## Tyler Loyal - Ferrari
Modern, crisp, airy RnB vocals done right. With this master I wanted to enhance those crystal clear vocals from Tyler using a combination of saturation and EQing to enhance the air and sparkle without introducing harshness for that creamy vocal sound. Shoutout to Kevin McCloskey for the dope mix.
