I also widened the strings for a truly immersive listening experience. Check out the final track...
## Tyler Loyal - Ferrari
Modern, crisp, airy RnB vocals done right. With this master I wanted to enhance those crystal clear vocals from Tyler using a combination of saturation and EQing to enhance the air and sparkle without introducing harshness for that creamy vocal sound. Shoutout to Kevin McCloskey for the dope mix.

## WSK Breezy -
This WSK Breezy production featured some crazy deep 808 hits I wanted to enhance in the master. Getting that sub impact that punches you in the guts while cleaning up the midrange to bring out some more definition to the airy vocals. Check it...
