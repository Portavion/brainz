## Notes
- Clipping noise as 3:22
- Something odd at 3:44 
- Try to have a bit of compression on the lead so it doesn't sound as much in your ear (master too punchy)
## Audio restoration
- fixed clicks at:
	- around 3min
	- crackle at 3:22
- reduced mouth click at 3:30 (can't eliminate but its a bit less distracting now)
- 3:44 is something to do with the tuning unfortunately I cant do much
