## Notes
- Clipping noise as 3:22
- Something odd at 3:44 
- Try to have a bit of compression on the lead so it doesn't sound as much in your ear (master too punchy)
## Audio restoration
- fixed clicks at:
	- around 3min
	- crackle at 3:22
- 3:44 is something to do with the vocal tuning going a little off on a note and unfortunately I cant do anything about that. I don't think it is too noticeable unless you really focus on it (i missed it on my first general listen for example)

In general spent a bunch of time hunting mouth clicks and smacks which were a little distracting (especially in the quieter sections) It's usually not an easy but with a ballad like this where there isn't much instrumentation going on it can really be noticeable. Mostly on the tail of each phrases. I managed to erase the worse ones and tame the rest.
## Mastering
Not much here, I like the balanced you guys achieved in the mix
