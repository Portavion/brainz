### Draft - Gemini
To whom it may concern,

I saw your listing for a role as Software Engineer at PlayStation and I was thrilled to see it. It is exactly the kind of job I have been looking for to apply my skills in data analysis whilst continuing the development of my software development knowledge.

Through my previous role in transport modeling at Arup I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving. While my experience lies in a slightly different field, I have developed a deep interest and proficiency in software engineering, particularly in web development using JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

I am eager to transition into a role where I can continuously learn and adapt to evolving technologies. I have experience in streamlining modelling processes through Python scripting which demonstrates my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them effectively. For example, at Arup, I rewrote our modelling software's COM interface using Python, reducing data import time from 3 hours to 5 minutes for a large-scale in Gatwick Airport. I also developed an interfacing process to automate data export between models, significantly reducing user input errors. I have also developed a suite of tools that leveraged the software's database to speed the creation of data analysis boilerplate and recurring charts/stats.

My passion in software engineering goes beyond my professional experience. I am currently developing a climbing workout tracker app using React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach with future backend data backup. You can find it on Github here: https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr

I am also building a web application to track Santander Cycles availability and docking space, featuring an improved search functionality, using React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend REST API, and a PostgreSQL database. GitHub: https://github.com/Portavion/velock

I am confident that my analytical skills, combined with my passion for software engineering make me a strong candidate for this role. I am looking forward to bringing my enthusiasm and dedication to your team and contribute to the continued success of PlayStation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guillaume
