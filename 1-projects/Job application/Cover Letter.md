### Draft - Gemini
To whom it may concern,

I saw your listing for a role as Software Engineer at PlayStation and I was thrilled to see it. It is exactly the kind of job I have been looking for to apply my skills in data analysis whilst continuing the development of my software development knowledge.

In my previous role as senior transport modeller at Arup I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving. While in a slightly different field, it also gave me a first experience of software development through Python and web development working alongside the city modelling team on a web dashboard (built with React and Node.js) helping stakeholders visualise carbon impact of new policies. I also have experience using SQL to query and analyse large data sets within my modelling work.

I am excited to transition into a position where I can continuously learn and adapt to new and evolving technologies. I have experience in streamlining processes through Python scripting which demonstrates my ability to quickly understand new concepts and apply them effectively. At Arup, I rewrote our microsimulation software's  COM interface in Python, reducing data import time from 3 hours to 5 minutes for a large project for Gatwick Airport. I also developed an interface for automating data export between models, completely removing user input errors. I have also developed a suite of tools that leveraged the software's database to speed the creation of data analysis boilerplate and recurring charts/stats.

My passion in software engineering goes beyond my professional experience. I am currently developing a climbing workout tracker app using React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach with future backend data backup. You can find more on the project's GitHub repo here: https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr

I am also building a web app to track Santander Cycles and docking space availability. Which also features an improved search. It is built with React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend REST API, and a PostgreSQL database. GitHub: https://github.com/Portavion/velock

I am confident that my analytical skills, with my passion for software development make me a strong candidate for this role. I am looking forward to bringing enthusiasm and dedication to your team and contribute to the continued success of PlayStation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guillaume

### Draft - what plan zero means to me
For me, Plan Zero is not just a target but also a personal effort. I am concerned about the climate crisis  and want to actively contribute to real solutions. It's also partially why I'm currently shifting career and industry. The trend in the transport consulting industry is moving towards projects that are not as focused on sustainability and environment which doesn't align with my values.

I want to be part of a team that's building a better future and I believe technology has a role to play in it. I'm excited by the idea of applying my skills to create tools and platforms that make a positive environmental impact. Finding a company that shares that vision is a big deal to me.
## Laka

To whom it may concern,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for a Software Engineer role at Laka. I've had questionable experiences with bike insurance in the past so your mission to build a better insurance resonates with me.

This, combined with my passion for software engineering, makes me confident that I have the skills to excel in this role. 
I am also particularly interested in Laka's tech stack, having prior experience with Node.js, React, SQL and currently learning Golang.

### Why laka?
I'm drawn to Laka for a few reasons. First, your focus on continuous learning and innovation is very important to me. First, I'm at a point in my career where continuous learning is very important. In my previous role, I found myself starting to stagnate knowledge wise. I am looking to transition into software engineering where I can constantly evolve and improve my skills, especially as technology advances. Secondly, Laka's mission to disrupt the cycle insurance industry with a fairer, people-powered model resonates with me. I've had my own frustrations with traditional bike insurance, so the idea of building a better solution is  appealing to me.

Dear Supercritical Hiring Team, 

I am writing to express my  interest in the Software Engineer position at Supercritical.  It is exactly the kind of job I have been looking for to apply my skills in data analysis whilst continuing the development of my software development knowledge. I am excited for the opportunity to be working closely in a small team as I believe this would drastically speed up development.

### **Why do you want to work at Supercritical? What appeals to you about working in a start-up in the sustainability space?**
The opportunity to work in a small, cooperative team setting and your dedication to sustainability are the two main reasons I wish to work at Supercritical.

I work best in smaller teams where I feel I can learn and develop my skills more rapidly. My first work experience at Systra was in a small team of 4 other senior colleagues. This facilitated rapid feedback and collaboration which significantly accelerated my learning. I believe joining Supercritical's team of three engineers will provide a similar positive environment.

Secondly, Supercritical's dedication to sustainability resonates with me. My career change is partly due to a desire to align work with my values. The transport consulting industry has recently shifted away from environmentally conscious projects to more profitable projects. Which is in conflict with my commitment to sustainability. I'm eager to work for a company that prioritises the environment and is actively working to address climate change.
