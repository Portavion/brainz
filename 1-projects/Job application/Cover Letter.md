### Draft - Gemini
Dear PlayStation Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Analytics Engineering Platform role at Sony Interactive Entertainment. I am excited at the opportunity to contribute to the innovation and development of PlayStation.

Through my previous role in transport modeling at Arup I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving. While my experience lies in a slightly different field, I have developed a keen interest and proficiency in software engineering, particularly in web development using JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

I am eager to transition into a role where I can continuously learn and adapt to evolving technologies. My experience in streamlining modeling processes through Python scripting and web development demonstrates my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them effectively. For example, at Arup, I rewrote the VISSIM software's COM interface using Python, reducing data import time for a large-scale Gatwick Airport project from 3 hours to 5 minutes. I also developed an interface for automated data export between models, significantly reducing manual input errors. Furthermore, I developed a suite of tools that leveraged the software's database to accelerate the creation of analysis boilerplate and recurring charts/stats.

My passion for software engineering extends beyond my professional experience. I am currently developing a climbing workout tracker app using React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach with future backend data backup. Additionally, I am building a web application to track Santander Cycles availability and docking space, featuring an improved search functionality, using React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend REST API, and a PostgreSQL database.

I am particularly drawn to the team's focus on building and maintaining internal systems as products, which aligns with my desire to create impactful and efficient solutions. I am committed to following industry best practices and ensuring the security and functionality of these systems.

I am confident that my analytical skills, combined with my passion for software engineering and my deep connection to the PlayStation brand, make me a strong candidate for this role. I am eager to bring my enthusiasm and dedication to your team and contribute to the continued success of PlayStation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guillaume
