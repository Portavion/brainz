### Draft - Gemini
To whom it may concern,

I saw your listing for a role as Software Engineer at PlayStation and I was thrilled to see it. It is exactly the kind of job I have been looking for to apply my skills in data analysis whilst continuing the development of my software development knowledge.

In my previous role as senior transport modeller at Arup I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving. While in a slightly different field, it also gave me a first experience of software development through Python and web development working alongside the city modelling team on a web dashboard (built with React and Node.js) helping stakeholders visualise carbon impact of new policies. I also have experience using SQL to query and analyse large data sets within my modelling work.

I am excited to transition into a position where I can continuously learn and adapt to new and evolving technologies. I have experience in streamlining processes through Python scripting which demonstrates my ability to quickly understand new concepts and apply them effectively. At Arup, I rewrote our microsimulation software's  COM interface in Python, reducing data import time from 3 hours to 5 minutes for a large project for Gatwick Airport. I also developed an interface for automating data export between models, completely removing user input errors. I have also developed a suite of tools that leveraged the software's database to speed the creation of data analysis boilerplate and recurring charts/stats.

My passion in software engineering goes beyond my professional experience. I am currently developing a climbing workout tracker app using React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach with future backend data backup. You can find more on the project's GitHub repo here: https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr

I am also building a web app to track Santander Cycles and docking space availability. Which also features an improved search. It is built with React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend REST API, and a PostgreSQL database. GitHub: https://github.com/Portavion/velock

I am confident that my analytical skills, with my passion for software development make me a strong candidate for this role. I am looking forward to bringing enthusiasm and dedication to your team and contribute to the continued success of PlayStation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guillaume

### Draft - what plan zero means to me
For me, Plan Zero is not just a target but also a personal effort. I am concerned about the climate crisis  and want to actively contribute to real solutions. It's also partially why I'm currently shifting career and industry. The trend in the transport consulting industry is moving towards projects that are not as focused on sustainability and environment which doesn't align with my values.

I want to be part of a team that's building a better future and I believe technology has a role to play in it. I'm excited by the idea of applying my skills to create tools and platforms that make a positive environmental impact. Finding a company that shares that vision is a big deal to me.

### Draft
To whom it may concern,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for a Software Engineer role at Laka. Your mission to build a better insurance for cyclists resonates with me, having had bad experiences in the past, and I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to building innovative software that changes an industry. 

In my previous role as senior transport modeller at Arup, I gained a strong foundation in problem-solving and a first experience of web development working alongside the city modelling team to create a web dashboard (built with React and Python). I also had first-hand experience using SQL to query and analyse large data sets within my modelling work. This experience, combined with my passion for software engineering, makes me confident that I have the skills to excel in this role. 
I am particularly interested in Laka's tech stack, having prior experience with Node.js, React, RESTful apis, Jest unit testing, SQL and being currently learning Golang.

My personal projects further demonstrate my capabilities: 
* **Chalkr (https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr):** A climbing workout tracker app built with React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach. This projects showcase my frontend development skills and ability to build robust applications. 

* **Velock (https://github.com/Portavion/velock):** A web app tracking Santander Cycles and docking space availability, featuring an improved search. Built with React, Node.js/Express, and a PostgreSQL database, this project demonstrates my experience with fullstack development and REST APIs. 

I am comfortable working in a remote-first environment and am eager to collaborate with your team to deliver high-quality code and contribute to Laka's continued success. I am confident that my experience with Node.js, React and SQL, coupled with my enthusiasm for building user-centric applications, makes me a great fit for this role. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Guillaume
