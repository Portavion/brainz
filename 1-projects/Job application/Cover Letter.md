### Draft - Gemini
To whom it may concern,

I saw your listing for a role as Software Engineer at PlayStation and I was thrilled to see it. It is exactly the kind of job I have been looking for to apply my skills in data analysis whilst continuing the development of my software development knowledge.

In my previous role as senior transport modeller at Arup I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving. While in a slightly different field, it also gave me a first experience of software development through Python and web development working alongside the city modelling team on a web dashboard (built with React and Node.js) helping stakeholders visualise carbon impact of new policies. I also have experience using SQL to query and analyse large data sets within my modelling work.

I am excited to transition into a position where I can continuously learn and adapt to new and evolving technologies. I have experience in streamlining processes through Python scripting which demonstrates my ability to quickly understand new concepts and apply them effectively. At Arup, I rewrote our microsimulation software's  COM interface in Python, reducing data import time from 3 hours to 5 minutes for a large project for Gatwick Airport. I also developed an interface for automating data export between models, completely removing user input errors. I have also developed a suite of tools that leveraged the software's database to speed the creation of data analysis boilerplate and recurring charts/stats.

My passion in software engineering goes beyond my professional experience. I am currently developing a climbing workout tracker app using React Native/Expo, Firebase Auth, and SQLite, focusing on an offline-first approach with future backend data backup. You can find more on the project's GitHub repo here: https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr

I am also building a web app to track Santander Cycles and docking space availability. Which also features an improved search. It is built with React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend REST API, and a PostgreSQL database. GitHub: https://github.com/Portavion/velock

I am confident that my analytical skills, with my passion for software development make me a strong candidate for this role. I am looking forward to bringing enthusiasm and dedication to your team and contribute to the continued success of PlayStation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Guillaume

### Draft - what plan zero means to me
For me, Plan Zero is not just a target but also a personal effort. I am concerned about the climate crisis  and want to actively contribute to real solutions. It's also partially why I'm currently shifting career and industry. The trend in the transport consulting industry is moving towards projects that are not as focused on sustainability and environment which doesn't align with my values.

I want to be part of a team that's building a better future and I believe technology has a role to play in it. I'm excited by the idea of applying my skills to create tools and platforms that make a positive environmental impact. Finding a company that shares that vision is a big deal to me.

### **Why do you want to work at Supercritical? What appeals to you about working in a start-up in the sustainability space?**
The opportunity to work in a small, cooperative team setting and your dedication to sustainability are the two main reasons I wish to work at Supercritical.

I work best in smaller teams where I feel I can learn and develop my skills much quicker. I started out at Systra in a small team with 4 other senior colleagues. This made it easy to collaborate and get quick feedback, which greatly increase my learning speed. I believe joining Supercritical's team of three engineers will create a similar positive environment.

Second, I align with Supercritical's commitment to sustainability. My career change is partly due to a desire to match work to my values. The transport consulting industry has recently shifted away from environmentally conscious projects to more profitable projects. Which is in conflict with my commitment to sustainability. I'm excited to work with an organization that values the environment and is taking proactive steps to combat climate change.
### **What makes you the best fit for this role?**
I think my excellent background in data analysis combined my ability to learn quickly and receive / act on feedback make me the best candidate for this role.

I taught myself web development, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and database technologies, which I hope demonstrates my ability to quickly learn and apply new skills. 

I have a lot of experience in data analysis through my previous role as transport modeller. Which also helped me develop an eye for detail and good problem-solving skills. I am great at identifying patterns, debugging problems, and ensuring the quality of data.

Finally, my personal projects showcase my ability to work across the stack. I've implemented frontend interfaces, designed backend APIs showing experience in building complete web applications. You are welcome to browse the github repos. I would be happy to discuss those projects in more details. (https://github.com/Portavion/Chalkr and https://github.com/Portavion/velock)

## Terra API

What interested me most about Terra is the product. I am actually in the process of building a mobile climbing / bouldering workout tracker and did a little bit of research as to how I could retrieve wearable data, and it was not looking pretty. I'm a bit of a data geek and was a bit disappointed with what Garmin provides for bouldering compared to activities like Running or cycling so decided to build my own solution. 

What interests me most about Terra API is the compelling fusion of health data, innovative UI/UX design, and your dynamic, customer-centric approach. Your mission to build the foundational infrastructure for health data resonates deeply, particularly as I’m passionate about fitness and data analysis. I’m eager to tackle the challenges of crafting intuitive interfaces and contributing to a platform that empowers users with meaningful health insights. The fact that I am currently developing a climbing/bouldering app because I found existing fitness data insights lacking shows my dedication to the space.

Terra's emphasis on speed, relentless pursuit of excellence, and a culture that values continuous learning aligns perfectly with my own professional aspirations. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can quickly develop my skills and make a tangible impact. The opportunity to transition into a career that aligns with my passions, while contributing to a mission-driven team, is incredibly exciting. I’m confident that my ability to approach engineering as a craft, combined with my customer-first mindset, would make me a valuable asset to Terra.
### Tell us about a time when you hacked a system to your advantage
For a transport modelling project for Gatwick Airport, I had to develop a significantly larger model than the software was typically designed for(a 24-hour model with over 90 origin-destination pairs, compared to the usual 1-hour, 15-pair models) This caused the standard VBA COM interface, used for automating data inputs, to slow down to a crawl, with the import process taking upward of three hours. To solve this, I bypassed the standard interface and rewrote the necessary features with a set of Python scripts. I managed to reduce the import time to around 10 minutes and the scripts are now standard for all modelling projects. This optimisation was done by disabling software UI updates and refining the order of the import steps to minimise background db queries. As a result, we were able to perform more calibration and validation iterations and deliver a much higher quality model.
### Tell us about something you've done in the past that can be considered as evidence of exceptional ability
For a masterplan project or the principality of Monaco, we faced the challenge of transforming the heavily car-centric road network into a pedestrian friendly environment, al within the very space-constrained streets.

My task was to develop a design solution that would maximise pedestrian space and improve the overall urban experience, while also managing a geographically dispersed team effectively.

Leveraging my understanding of traffic flow and urban design, I proposed a bold, unconventional solution: a primarily one-way traffic system with strategic two-way bypasses. This approach, though a significant departure from the existing system, allowed us to reclaim entire traffic lanes for expanded pedestrian walkways, greenery, and public amenities. To manage the team, I implemented an asynchronous communication strategy, freeing up time for design exploration.
