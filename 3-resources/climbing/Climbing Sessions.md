# Session 1: Technique (~80 min)
## Warm-Up

### Glue Hands and Feet (~10 min)
Climb five boulders that are below your level (that you can easily climb without much difficulty) and limit your adjustments. Take 30 sec–1 min rest in between, shake your arms out.
### Climb Silently (~10 min)
Climb five boulders that are below your level (that you can easily climb without much difficulty) and try to make no noise. Take 30 sec–1 min rest in between, shake your arms out.
## Training
### Mastery Climbing (~45 min)
Pick 2-3 boulders in different styles that you can flash (climb on your first try), but are at the edge of your ability level. Climb each problem 2-5 times, each time looking for more efficient ways, and better techniques. Give yourself 2-3 minutes rest between each attempt.
### Film Yourself (~15 min)
Pick a climb that is difficult for you and you can’t flash. Film yourself climbing it. After your attempt look at the footage and identify one part of your technique you want to improve. Focus on this element during your next attempt. Rest 3-5 minutes. Repeat 2-3 times.
