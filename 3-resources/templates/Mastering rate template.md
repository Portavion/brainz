# Mastering Rate Template
Thanks a lot man, appreciate it. Off course, feel free to send stuff my way, always happy to take a listen and give some feedback. Did you get it mixed already? My email is guillaume@micronmastering.com  
  
For mastering my rate in 100usd per stereo master. That includes mix notes if you still have revisions available and then some audio restoration to fix potential clicks / artefacts, random mouth noise / sibilance and other artefacts that might have slipped through
