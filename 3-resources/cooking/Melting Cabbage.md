# Melting Cabbage
## Ingredients

- 1 small head green cabbage (1 kg), outermost leaves removed
- ½ cup coarsely chopped drained julienne-cut sun-dried tomatoes in oil, plus 3 tablespoons oil from jar, divided
- 500ml no-salt-added vegetable broth
- ¼ cup​ heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed and softened
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons water
- ½ cup​ grated Parmesan cheese plus 1 tablespoon, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- Chopped fresh basil for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Slice cabbage in half through the root. Cut each half into 4 wedges, keeping core intact. Heat 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in a large, enamel-coated cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 cabbage wedges; cook until deeply browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side; transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and the remaining 4 cabbage wedges. Do not wipe the skillet clean.
2. Add sun-dried tomatoes, broth, cream, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, the minced garlic, the softened cream cheese, ¼ teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet; cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until well combined and boiling, about 2 minutes.
3. Stir 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 2 teaspoons water together in a small bowl until fully combined. Whisk into the mixture in the skillet; remove from heat. Whisk in Parmesan until melted, about 1 minute.
4. Sprinkle the tops of the cabbage wedges with ¼ teaspoon pepper and the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt; nestle the wedges into the skillet, overlapping just slightly if needed to fit in a single layer.
5. Bake until the cabbage is fork-tender and the sauce has slightly thickened, 50 minutes to 1 hour, flipping the cabbage halfway through. Sprinkle the cabbage with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Garnish with basil, if desired.
