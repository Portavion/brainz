## Ingredients (serves 6)
- 9 pak choi
- 2tbsp groundnut oil
- 2tbsp toasted sesameoil
- garlic clove crushed and finely chopped
- chilli seeded and finely chopped
- 1tbsp Thai fish sauce (optional)
- 1tbsp sesame seeds toasted (optional) 
## Instructions

1. Cut a thick slice from the pak choi root to separate the leaves. Rinse and drain.
2. Heat the groundnut oil in a large wok over a medium heat and add 1 tbsp sesame oil, the garlic, chilli, fish sauce (if using) and pak choi. Toss until coated and clamp a pan lid over them. Reduce the heat and cook for 3-6 minutes, tossing occasionally, just until the leaves have wilted (the stalks should be tender-crisp).
3. Add the rest of the sesame oil and salt. Toss the leaves, scatter over the sesame seeds if you wish, and serve immediately.
