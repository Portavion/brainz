## What to serve with Chicken Piccata
Serve with your choice of:
- Plain buttered pasta
- Rice
## Ingredients

- 1 fresh lemon 
- 1/4 bunch Italian parsley 
- 3 cloves garlic 
- 2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 lbs)​【900 g】 ($6.25)
- Pinch salt and pepper ($0.05)
- 1/2 cup​【118 mL】 flour ($0.03)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.26)
- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.28)
- 1/2 cup​【118 mL】 chicken broth\* ($0.07)
- 1 Tbsp capers ($0.40)

- Prepare the lemon, parsley, and garlic so they’re ready to go when you need them. Roughly chop the parsley leaves, juice the lemon, and mince the garlic. Set these ingredients aside.
- Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat. Cover them with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness (about 1/2-3/4 inch​【7 cm】 thick). Cut each chicken breast in half so that you have four to six pieces about the size of the palm of your hand. Season both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
- Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet, over medium heat. While the oil is heating, place the flour in a bowl and lightly coat each piece of chicken on both sides. When the oil is very hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side (about 3-5 minutes on each side). Cook the chicken in batches, if needed, to prevent them from overcrowding the skillet. Transfer the browned chicken on a clean plate.
- After removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the butter and minced garlic. Sauté the garlic in the butter for about one minute. Add the chicken broth and lemon juice to the skillet and whisk to dissolve (or “deglaze”) the brown bits off of the bottom of the pan.
- Add the capers and half of the chopped parsley to the skillet. Increase the heat to medium, add the chicken back to the skillet, and spoon the sauce over top. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce for 3-5 minutes, without a lid, or until the sauce reduces by half. The flour on the chicken will help thicken the sauce as it simmers. Sprinkle the remaining parsley over top just before serving.

## **How to Make Chicken Piccata – Step By Step Photos**

![Overhead view of lemon juice, chopped parsley, and minced garlic.](https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Lemon-Parsley-and-Garlilc-for-Chicken-Piccatta.jpg)

Start by preparing the sauce ingredients. Pull the leaves from about 1/4 bunch of parsley and then give them a rough chop. Juice the lemon (you’ll want between 1/3 cup​【79 mL】 and 1/2 cup​【118 mL】, it’s flexible). Mince three cloves of garlic.

![Pound Chicken Breasts for Chicken PIccatta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Pound-Chicken-Breasts-for-Chicken-Piccatta.jpg)

This recipe will make enough sauce for about 2 pounds​【900 g】 of chicken breasts, or 2-3 boneless skinless breasts, depending on their size. I had two breasts left in my freezer, one of which was rather large. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover with a large piece of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken, concentrating on the thicker end, until the piece is an even thickness from one end to the other (about 1/2 to 3/4 inch​【1,9 cm】 thick).

Next, cut each piece of pounded chicken into 2 (or three if it’s extra large) pieces about the size of the palm of your hand. Season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place 1/2 cup​【118 mL】 flour in a wide shallow bowl and dip each piece of chicken in the flour until it is lightly coated on each side.

Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it is shimmering. Add the chicken pieces and cook on each side until golden brown (about 3-5 minutes each side). Cook the chicken in two batches if your skillet is on the smaller side, to prevent over crowding, which will cause the juices to pool. You want some of the flour and chicken to brown on the bottom of the skillet.

Once the chicken has browned, remove it to a clean plate and turn the heat down to medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and the minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté for about one minute or just until the garlic is softened a bit.

![Deglaze Pan for Chicken Piccatta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Deglaze-Pan-for-Chicken-Piccatta.jpg)

Add 1/2 cup​【118 mL】 chicken broth and the lemon juice to the skillet. Stir or whisk until all the brown bits dissolve off the bottom.

![Add Capers and Parsley to Chicken Piccatta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Add-Capers-and-Parsley-to-Chicken-Piccatta.jpg)

Add half of the chopped parsley and 1 Tbsp capers to the sauce. Return the chicken pieces to the skillet and spoon the sauce over top. Allow the skillet to return to a simmer. Continue simmering for 3-5 minutes without a lid, or until the sauce is reduced by half. Spoon the sauce over the chicken a few times as it simmers.

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley just before serving. I also happened to have an extra lemon, so I added lemon slices for visual effect, but you don’t need them for flavor. The sauce is QUITE flavorful on its own.
