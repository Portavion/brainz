- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast - about 1.3 lb (590 g)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 cup (237 ml) chicken broth
- 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/3 cup(79 ml) heavy cream
- 2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cups (473 ml) spinach

## Steps

1. Mix together the seasoning for the chicken in a small bowl:
   Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder,
   salt and freshly cracked black pepper.
2. Carefully fillet each chicken breast into two thinner cutlets.
   Season each breast with the seasoning mix on both sides.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil.
   Once the skillet is hot, add the chicken and cook on each side until golden brown
   and cooked through (about 4 minutes per side).
   Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.
4. To the same skillet add the butter and minced garlic cloves.
   Turn the heat down to medium-low and saut√© the garlic for one minute until fragrant.
5. Next pour the chicken broth into the skillet and add the Dijon mustard
   and Worcestershire sauce. Stir together and scrape up any brown bits that
   may be stuck to the bottom of the pan.
6. Add in the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese and stir well.
   Allow the sauce to simmer in the skillet for 5 minutes.
   Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper if desired.
7. Add in the fresh spinach and stir it into the sauce
   allowing the heat to wilt the spinach.
8. Finally, return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet
   and spoon the Dijon sauce over top. Allow the chicken to heat through.
9. Serve hot with your favorite side and enjoy!
