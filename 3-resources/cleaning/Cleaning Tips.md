# Cleaning Tips
- clean one room at a time or focus on a single thing to avoid distractions
- Let cleaning product sit to use their full potential
- Set a timer for 15 minutes and do some cleaning
- Try the pomodoro method for cleaning: clean for 20 minutes then take a 10 minutes break
- Work top to bottom
- Close the kitchen every night (dishes, basic cleaning tasks etc..)
